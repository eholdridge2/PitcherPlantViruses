"1","Fitness benefits to bacteria of carrying prophages and prophage-encoded antibiotic-resistance genes peak in different environments","Wendling, CC and Refardt, D and Hall, AR","EVOLUTION","Understanding the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in adaptation is a key challenge in evolutionary biology. In microbes, an important mechanism of HGT is prophage acquisition (phage genomes integrated into bacterial chromosomes). Prophages can influence bacterial fitness via the transfer of beneficial genes (including antibiotic-resistance genes, ARGs), protection from superinfecting phages, or switching to a lytic lifecycle that releases free phages infectious to competitors. We expect these effects to depend on environmental conditions because of, for example, environment-dependent induction of the lytic lifecycle. However, it remains unclear how costs/benefits of prophages vary across environments. Here, studying prophages with/without ARGs in Escherichia coli, we disentangled the effects of prophages alone and adaptive genes they carry. In competition with prophage-free strains, benefits from prophages and ARGs peaked in different environments. Prophages were most beneficial when induction of the lytic lifecycle was common, whereas ARGs were more beneficial upon antibiotic exposure and with reduced prophage induction. Acquisition of prophage-encoded ARGs by competing strains was most common when prophage induction, and therefore free phages, were common. Thus, selection on prophages and adaptive genes they carry varies independently across environments, which is important for predicting the spread of mobile/integrating genetic elements and their role in evolution.","Antibiotic resistance; fitness; lysogen; mobile genetic elements; and prophage; temperate phage","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & and Heredity","2021"
"2","Seasonal dynamics in taxonomy and function within bacterial and viral metagenomic assemblages recovered from a freshwater agricultural pond","Chopyk, J and Nasko, DJ and Allard, S and Bui, A and Pop, M and Mongodin, EF and Sapkota, AR","ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOME","Background Ponds are important freshwater habitats that support both human and environmental activities. However, relative to their larger counterparts (e.g. rivers, lakes), ponds are understudied, especially with regard to their microbial communities. Our study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by using culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing to assess the dynamics, taxonomy, and functionality of bacterial and viral communities in a freshwater agricultural pond. Results Water samples (n = 14) were collected from a Mid-Atlantic agricultural pond between June 2017 and May 2018 and filtered sequentially through 1 and 0.2 mu m filter membranes. Total DNA was then extracted from each filter, pooled, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Additionally, on eight occasions water filtrates were processed for viral metagenomes (viromes) using chemical concentration and then shotgun sequenced. A ubiquitous freshwater phylum, Proteobacteria was abundant at all sampling dates throughout the year. However, environmental characteristics appeared to drive the structure of the community. For instance, the abundance of Cyanobacteria (e.g. Nostoc) increased with rising water temperatures, while a storm event appeared to trigger an increase in overall bacterial diversity, as well as the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. This event was also associated with an increase in the number of antibiotic resistance genes. The viral fractions were dominated by dsDNA of the order Caudovirales, namely Siphoviridae and Myovirdae. Conclusions Overall, this study provides one of the largest datasets on pond water microbial ecology to date, revealing seasonal trends in the microbial taxonomic composition and functional potential.","Metagenome; Shotgun; Agricultural irrigation; Antibiotic resistance; and Microbial communities; Bacteria; Bacteriophage","Genetics & Heredity; Microbiology","2020"
"3","Comprehensive metagenomic insights into a unique mass gathering and bathing event reveals transient influence on a riverine ecosystem","Yadav, R and Rajput, V and Gohil, K and Khairnar, K and Dharne, M","ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY","The religious mass gathering and bathing can pose a multitude of significant public health challenges and lead to severe alterations in the river microbial ecology. The Pandharpur Wari is an annual pilgrimage of Maharashtra, India, where millions of devotees carry the footprints of the saint-poets and pay their obeisance to Lord Vitthal on the 11th day of moon's waxing phase (Ashadi Ekadashi). As a part of the ritual, the engrossed devotees, walk over 250 km, take a first holy dip in a sacred river Indrayani at Alandi and secondly in Bhima River at Pandharpur. The MinION-based shotgun metagenomic approach was employed to examine the impact of spiritual mass bathing on environmental changes (concerning the river microbial community structure and functions); and public health aspects (in terms of changes in the pathogenic potential and antibiotic resistance). The analysis of bathing and post-bathing samples of both the rivers revealed alterations in the alpha and beta diversity, indicating significant spatiotemporal variations in the overall microbial structure and function. Furthermore, the analysis revealed up to 80% of differences in the abundance of virulence genes between the bathing and post bathing samples. We observed parallel increase of priority skin and enteric pathogens (ranging from 11% to 80%) such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa during the bathing event. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the antibiotic resistance in the bathing samples of Bhima and Indrayani rivers respectively. Altogether, this is the first comprehensive metagenomic study unravelling the influence of religious mass-bathing on the riverine ecosystem.","Mass bathing; Virulence genes; Antibiotic resistance; Priority and pathogens; MinION sequencing","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology","2020"
"4","Quantification of Lysogeny Caused by Phage Coinfections in Microbial Communities from Biophysical Principles","Luque, A and Silveira, CB","MSYSTEMS","Temperate phages can associate with their bacterial host to form a lysogen, often modifying the phenotype of the host. Lysogens are dominant in the microbially dense environment of the mammalian gut. This observation contrasts with the long-standing hypothesis of lysogeny being favored at low microbial densities, such as in oligotrophic marine environments. Here, we hypothesized that phage coinfections-a well-understood molecular mechanism of lysogenization-increase at high microbial abundances. To test this hypothesis, we developed a biophysical model of coinfection for marine and gut microbiomes. The model stochastically sampled ranges of phage and bacterial concentrations, adsorption rates, lysogenic commitment times, and community diversity from each environment. In 90% of the sampled marine communities, less than 10% of the bacteria were predicted to be lysogenized via coinfection. In contrast, 25% of the sampled gut communities displayed more than 25% of lysogenization. The probability of lysogenization in the gut was a consequence of the higher densities and higher adsorption rates. These results suggest that, on average, coinfections can form two trillion lysogens in the human gut every day. In marine microbiomes, which were characterized by lower densities and phage adsorption rates, lysogeny via coinfection was still possible for communities with long lysogenic commitment times. Our study indicates that different physical factors causing coinfections can reconcile the traditional view of lysogeny at poor host growth (long commitment times) and the recent Piggyback-the-Winner framework proposing that lysogeny is favored in rich environments (high densities and adsorption rates). IMPORTANCE The association of temperate phages and bacterial hosts during lysogeny manipulates microbial dynamics from the oceans to the human gut. Lysogeny is well studied in laboratory models, but its environmental drivers remain unclear. Here, we quantified the probability of lysogenization caused by phage coinfections, a well-known trigger of lysogeny, in marine and gut microbial environments. Coinfections were quantified by developing a biophysical model that incorporated the traits of viral and bacterial communities. Lysogenization via coinfection was more frequent in highly productive environments like the gut, due to higher microbial densities and higher phage adsorption rates. At low cell densities, lysogenization occurred in bacteria with long duplication times. These results bridge the molecular understanding of lysogeny with the ecology of complex microbial communities.","stochastic biophysical model; lysogeny; microbial abundance; and multiplicity of infection; adsorption rates; commitment time","Microbiology","2020"
"5","Growth velocity in children with Environmental Enteric Dysfunction is associated with specific bacterial and viral taxa of the gastrointestinal tract in Malawian children","Desai, C and Handley, SA and Rodgers, R and Rodriguez, C and Ordiz, MI and Manary, MJ and Holtz, LR","PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES","Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is characterized by diffuse villous atrophy of the small bowel. EED is strongly associated with stunting, a major public health problem linked to increased childhood morbidity and mortality. EED and subsequent stunting of linear growth are surmised to have microbial origins. To interrogate this relationship, we defined the comprehensive virome (eukaryotic virus and bacteriophage) and bacterial microbiome of a longitudinal cohort of rural Malawian children with extensive metadata and intestinal permeability testing at each time point. We found thirty bacterial taxa differentially associated with linear growth. We detected many eukaryotic viruses. Neither the total number of eukaryotic families nor a specific viral family was statistically associated with improved linear growth. We identified 3 differentially abundant bacteriophage among growth velocities. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between bacteria and bacteriophage richness in children with subsequent adequate/moderate growth which children with subsequent poor growth lacked. This suggests that a disruption in the equilibrium between bacteria and bacteriophage communities might be associated with subsequent poor growth. Future studies of EED and stunting should include the evaluation of viral communities in addition to bacterial microbiota to understand the complete microbial ecology of these poorly understood entities. Author summary Stunting (poor linear growth) is a major global problem. Stunting affects one-third of the half-billion preschool children in low and middle-income countries and is associated with similar to 20% of all-cause deaths before age five. Stunting is believed to be a consequence of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED). EED is a gut inflammatory process that is endemic in children living in low and middle-income countries. EED and, by extension, stunting are thought to have microbial origins. However, attempts to find specific pathogens that drive (or protect from) EED have not been fruitful. Here, we define the comprehensive gut virome, which includes viruses that infect humans and animals and viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophage) and the bacterial gut microbiome in rural Malawian children. These participants are very well characterized (with careful growth measurements and intestinal permeability testing), enabling us to more precisely correlate the populations of viruses and bacteria in their stool with how well, or how poorly, the children are growing. We found thirty bacterial species and three bacteriophage that were differentially associated with linear growth in the three months after sampling. We found a positive correlation between bacteria and bacteriophage richness in children with subsequent adequate and moderate linear growth which children with subsequent poor growth lacked. Our data suggest that disrupting the bacteria-bacteriophage equilibrium between bacteria and bacteriophage communities might impair childhood linear growth.",NA,"Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine","2020"
"6","Initial Mapping of the New York City Wastewater Virome","Gulino, K and Rahman, J and Badri, M and Morton, J and Bonneau, R and Ghedin, E","MSYSTEMS","Bacteriophages are abundant members of all microbiomes studied to date, influencing microbial communities through interactions with their bacterial hosts. Despite their functional importance and ubiquity, phages have been underexplored in urban environments compared to their bacterial counterparts. We profiled the viral communities in New York City (NYC) wastewater using metagenomic data collected in November 2014 from 14 wastewater treatment plants. We show that phages accounted for the largest viral component of the sewage samples and that specific virus communities were associated with local environmental conditions within boroughs. The vast majority of the virus sequences had no homology matches in public databases, forming an average of 1,700 unique virus clusters (putative genera). These new clusters contribute to elucidating the overwhelming proportion of data that frequently goes unidentified in viral metagenomic studies. We assigned potential hosts to these phages, which appear to infect a wide range of bacterial genera, often outside their presumed host. We determined that infection networks form a modular-nested pattern, indicating that phages include a range of host specificities, from generalists to specialists, with most interactions organized into distinct groups. We identified genes in viral contigs involved in carbon and sulfur cycling, suggesting functional importance of viruses in circulating pathways and gene functions in the wastewater environment. In addition, we identified virophage genes as well as a nearly complete novel virophage genome. These findings provide an understanding of phage abundance and diversity in NYC wastewater, previously uncharacterized, and further examine geographic patterns of phagehost association in urban environments. IMPORTANCE Wastewater is a rich source of microbial life and contains bacteria, viruses, and other microbes found in human waste as well as environmental runoff sources. As part of an effort to characterize the New York City wastewater metagenome, we profiled the viral community of sewage samples across all five boroughs of NYC and found that local sampling sites have unique sets of viruses. We focused on bacteriophages, or viruses of bacteria, to understand how they may influence the microbial ecology of this system. We identified several new clusters of phages and successfully associated them with bacterial hosts, providing insight into virus-host interactions in urban wastewater. This study provides a first look into the viral communities present across the wastewater system in NYC and points to their functional importance in this environment.","bacteriophage; metagenomics; virome","Microbiology","2020"

Despite recent progress in viral metagenomics, the inherent genetic complexity of virus populations still poses technical difficulties for recovering complete virus genomes from natural assemblages. To address these challenges, we developed an assembly-free, single-molecule nanopore sequencing approach, enabling direct recovery of complete virus genome sequences from environmental samples. Our method yielded thousands of full-length, high-quality draft virus genome sequences that were not recovered using standard short-read assembly approaches. Additionally, our analyses discriminated between populations whose genomes had identical direct terminal repeats versus those with circularly permuted repeats at their termini, thus providing new insight into native virus reproduction and genome packaging. Novel DNA sequences were discovered, whose repeat structures, gene contents, and concatemer lengths suggest they are phage-inducible chromosomal islands, which are packaged as concatemers in phage particles, with lengths that match the size ranges of co-occurring phage genomes. Our new virus sequencing strategy can provide previously unavailable information about the genome structures, population biology, and ecology of naturally occurring viruses and viral parasites.",NA,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; and Genetics & Heredity","2020"
"8","Charting the diversity of uncultured viruses of Archaea and Bacteria","Coutinho, FH and Edwards, RA and Rodriguez-Valera, F","BMC BIOLOGY","Background Viruses of Archaea and Bacteria are among the most abundant and diverse biological entities on Earth. Unraveling their biodiversity has been challenging due to methodological limitations. Recent advances in culture-independent techniques, such as metagenomics, shed light on the unknown viral diversity, revealing thousands of new viral nucleotide sequences at an unprecedented scale. However, these novel sequences have not been properly classified and the evolutionary associations between them were not resolved. Results Here, we performed phylogenomic analysis of nearly 200,000 viral nucleotide sequences to establish GL-UVAB: Genomic Lineages of Uncultured Viruses of Archaea and Bacteria. The pan-genome content of the identified lineages shed light on some of their infection strategies, potential to modulate host physiology, and mechanisms to escape host resistance systems. Furthermore, using GL-UVAB as a reference database for annotating metagenomes revealed elusive habitat distribution patterns of viral lineages and environmental drivers of community composition.

However, very little is known about RNA viruses in an environmental context, and even less is known about their diversity and ecology in soil, 1 of the most complex microbial systems. Here, we assembled 48 individual metatranscriptomes from 4 habitats within a planted soil sampled over a 22-d time series: Rhizosphere alone, detritosphere alone, rhizosphere with added root detritus, and unamended soil (4 time points and 3 biological replicates). We resolved the RNA viral community, uncovering a high diversity of viral sequences. We also investigated possible host organisms by analyzing metatranscriptome marker genes. Based on viral phylogeny, much of the diversity was Narnaviridae that may parasitize fungi or Leviviridae, which may infect Proteobacteria. Both host and viral communities appear to be highly dynamic, and rapidly diverged depending on experimental conditions. The viral and host communities were structured based on the presence of root litter. Clear temporal dynamics by Leviviridae and their hosts indicated that viruses were replicating. With this time-resolved analysis, we show that RNA viruses are diverse, abundant, and active in soil. When viral infection causes host cell death, it may mobilize cell carbon in a process that may represent an overlooked component of soil carbon cycling.","virus; phage; soil; rhizosphere; metatranscriptome","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2019"
"10","Filamentous phages reduce bacterial growth in low salinities","Goehlich, H and Roth, O and Wendling, CC","ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE","Being non-lytic, filamentous phages can replicate at high frequencies and often carry virulence factors, which are important in the evolution and emergence of novel pathogens. However, their net effect on bacterial fitness remains unknown. To understand the ecology and evolution between filamentous phages and their hosts, it is important to assess (i) fitness effects of filamentous phages on their hosts and (ii) how these effects depend on the environment. To determine how the net effect on bacterial fitness by filamentous phages changes across environments, we constructed phage-bacteria infection networks at ambient 15 practical salinity units (PSU) and stressful salinities (11 and 7 PSU) using the marine bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus and its derived filamentous phages as model system. We observed no significant difference in network structure at 15 and 11 PSU. However, at 7 PSU phages significantly reduced bacterial growth changing network structure. This pattern was mainly driven by a significant increase in bacterial susceptibility. Our findings suggest that filamentous phages decrease bacterial growth, an indirect measure of fitness in stressful environmental conditions, which might impact bacterial communities, alter horizontal gene transfer events and possibly favour the emergence of novel pathogens in environmental Vibrios.","phage-bacteria infection network; Vibrio; filamentous phages; salinity and changes","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2019"

The pathogen ""Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus"" is an alphaproteobacterium of the Rhizobiaceae family that has been identified as the causative agent of HLB. The virulence of ""Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus"" has been attributed, in part, to prophage-carried genes. Prophage and prophage-like elements have been identified in 12 of the 15 available ""Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus"" genomes and are classified into three prophage types. Here, we reexamined all 15 ""Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus"" genomes using a de novo prediction approach and expanded the number of prophage-like elements from 16 to 33. Further, we found that all of the ""Ca.

Comparative analysis revealed a prevalent, albeit previously unknown, prophage-like sequence type that is a remnant of an integrated prophage. Notably, this remnant prophage is found in the Ishi-1 ""Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus"" strain that had previously been reported as lacking prophages. Our findings provide both a resource for data and new insights into the evolutionary relationship between phage and ""Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus"" pathogenicity.

Consequently, their bacteriophages may have significant impact on human microbial ecology and pathologies. Our aim was to reveal the prevalence and diversity of bacteriophages infecting Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus species that colonize the human body. Genome mining with comparative genomics, screening of clinical isolates, and profiling of metagenomes allowed characterization of 346 phages grouped in 52 clusters and 18 superclusters. Less than 10% of the identified phage clusters were represented by previously characterized phages. Prophage diversity patterns varied significantly for different phage types, host clades, and environmental niches. A more diverse phage community lysogenizes Haemophilus infiuenzae and Haemophilus parainfiuenzae strains than Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and ""Haemophilus ducreyi"". Co-infections occurred more often in ""H. ducreyi"". Phages from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans preferably lysogenized strains of specific serotype. Prophage patterns shared by subspecies clades of different bacterial species suggest similar ecoevolutionary drivers. Changes in frequencies of DNA uptake signal sequences and guanine-cytosine content reflect phage-host long-term coevolution. Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus phages were prevalent at multiple oral sites. Together, these findings should help exploring the ecoevolutionary forces shaping virus-host interactions in the human microbiome.

We developed a new generation of FGA, GeoChip 5.0, using the Agilent platform. Two formats were created, a smaller format (GeoChip 5.0S), primarily covering carbon-, nitrogen-, sulfur-, and phosphorus-cycling genes and others providing ecological services, and a larger format (GeoChip 5.0M) containing the functional categories involved in biogeochemical cycling of C, N, S, and P and various metals, stress response, microbial defense, electron transport, plant growth promotion, virulence, gyr13, and fungus-, protozoan-, and virus-specific genes.

Computational and experimental evaluation indicated that designed probes were highly specific and could detect as little as 0.05 ng of pure culture DNAs within a background of 1 mu g community DNA (equivalent to 0.005% of the population). Additionally, strong quantitative linear relationships were observed between signal intensity and amount of pure genomic (similar to 99% of probes detected; r > 0.9) or soil (similar to 97%; r > 0.9) DNAs. Application of the GeoChip to a contaminated groundwater microbial community indicated that environmental contaminants (primarily heavy metals) had significant impacts on the biodiversity of the communities.

By using a set of statistic approaches (non-metric dimensional scaling, Bray-Curtis distance, PERMANOVA), we analysed phenotypic (host range on wild-type and receptor mutants) and genetic data (taxonomic assignment and receptor binding proteins) to evaluate the impact of isolation strain and niche, phage receptor and genus on the host range. Statistical analysis revealed that two phage characteristics influence the host range by explaining the most variance: the receptor by 45% and the genus by 51%. Interestingly, phage genus and receptor in combination explained 79% of the variance, establishing these characteristics as the major determinants of the host range.

Despite this, research in viral identification and dynamics is scarce, with limited information available for the Southern Ocean (SO). This study presents an integrative-omics approach, comparing variation in the viral and microbial active communities on two contrasting sample conditions from a diatom-dominated phytoplankton bloom occurring in Chile Bay in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) in the summer of 2014. The known viral community, initially dominated by Myoviridae family (similar to 82% of the total assigned reads), changed to become dominated by Phycodnaviridae (similar to 90%), while viral activity was predominantly driven by dsDNA members of the Phycodnaviridae (similar to 50%) and diatom infecting ssRNA viruses (similar to 38%), becoming more significant as chlorophyll a increased. A genomic and phylogenetic characterization allowed the identification of a new viral lineage within the Myoviridae family. This new lineage of viruses infects Pseudoalteromonas and was dominant in the phage community. In addition, a new Phycodnavirus (PaV) was described, which is predicted to infect Phaeocystis antarctica, the main blooming haptophyte in the SO. This work was able to identify the changes in the main viral players during a bloom development and suggests that the changes observed in the virioplankton could be used as a model to understand the development and decay of blooms that occur throughout the WAP.","phytoplankton blooms; Southern Ocean; viruses; environmental genomics; and viral ecology","Microbiology","2019"

The host grew in media between pH 6-8.5, had a salinity growth optimum of 20% total salts (ranging from 10%-30%) and an upper temperature growth limit of 48 degrees C. The host utilized 61 of 190 substrates tested using BIOLOG Phenotype MicroArrays. The CG phi 29 phage, one of only four reported Salicola phages, is a DNA virus of the Siphoviridae family. Overall, the phage tolerated a broader range of environmental conditions than its host (salinity 0-30% total salts; pH 3-9; upper thermal limit 80 degrees C) and is the most thermotolerant halophilic phage ever reported.

Yet their dynamics have seldom been studied in engineered systems, or indeed in any system, for long periods of time. We measured virus abundance in a full-scale activated sludge plant every week for two years. Total bacteria and ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) abundances, bacterial community profiles, and a suite of environmental and operational parameters were also monitored. Mixed liquor virus abundance fluctuated over an order of magnitude (3.18 x 10(8) -3.41 x 10 virus's mL(-1)) and that variation was statistically significantly associated with total bacterial and AOB abundance, community composition, and effluent concentrations of COD and NH4+-N and thus system function. This suggests viruses play a far more important role in the dynamics of activated sludge systems than previously realised and could be one of the key factors controlling bacterial abundance, community structure and functional stability and may cause reactors to fail. These findings are based on statistical associations, not mechanistic models. Nevertheless, viral associations with abiotic factors, such as pH, make physical sense, giving credence to these findings and highlighting the role that physical factors play in virus ecology. Further work is needed to identify and quantify specific bacteriophage and their hosts to enable us to develop mechanistic models of the ecology of viruses in wastewater treatment systems. However, since we have shown that viruses can be related to effluent quality and virus quantification is simple and cheap, practitioners would probably benefit from quantifying viruses now.

A better understanding of the interactions between these processes across different types of environments is key to elucidate how phages mediate microbial competition and to design efficient phage therapies. We introduce an individual-based model (eVIVALDI) to investigate the role of environmental structure in the elimination of a population with a combined treatment of antibiotics and virulent phages, and in the invasion of a population of phage-sensitive bacteria by lysogens. We show that structured environments facilitate the emergence of double resistance, to antibiotics and phages, due to limited diffusion of phage particles and increased nutrient availability from dead cells. They also hinder phage amplification, thus decreasing the generation of phage genetic diversity and increasing the unpredictability of phage-bacteria arms-races. We used a machine learning approach to determine the variables most important for the invasion of sensitive populations by lysogens. They revealed that phage-associated traits and environmental structure are the key drivers of the process. Structured environments hinder invasions, and accounting for their existence improves the fit of the model to published in vivo experimental data.

They are required for virtually all cellular life and are prominent within viral genomes. RNRs share a common ancestor and must generate a protein radical for direct ribonucleotide reduction. The mechanisms by which RNRs produce radicals are diverse and divide RNRs into three major classes and several subclasses. The diversity of radical generation methods means that cellular organisms and viruses typically contain the RNR best-suited to the environmental conditions surrounding DNA replication. However, such diversity has also fostered high rates of RNR misannotation within subject sequence databases. These misannotations have resulted in incorrect translative presumptions of RNR biochemistry and have diminished the utility of this marker gene for ecological studies of viruses. We discovered a misannotation of the RNR gene within the Prochlorococcus phage P-SSP7 genome, which caused a chain of misannotations within commonly observed RNR genes from marine virioplankton communities. These RNRs are found in marine cyanopodo- and cyanosiphoviruses and are currently misannotated as Class II RNRs, which are O-2-independent and require cofactor B-12. In fact, these cyanoviral RNRs are Class I enzymes that are O-2-dependent and may require a di-metal cofactor made of Fe, Mn, or a combination of the two metals. The discovery of an overlooked Class I beta subunit in the P-SSP7 genome, together with phylogenetic analysis of the alpha and beta subunits confirms that the RNR from P-SSP7 is a Class I RNR. Phylogenetic and conserved residue analyses also suggest that the P-SSP7 RNR may constitute a novel Class I subclass. The reannotation of the RNR Glade represented by P-SSP7 means that most lytic cyanophage contain Class I RNRs, while their hosts, B-12-producing Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, contain Class II RNRs. By using a Class I RNR, cyanophage avoid a dependence on host-produced B-12, a more effective strategy for a lytic virus. The discovery of a novel RNR beta subunit within cyanopodoviruses also implies that some unknown viral genes may be familiar cellular genes that are too divergent for homology-based annotation methods to identify.","cyanophage; ribonucleotide reductase; marker gene; misannotation; and cyanobacteria; viral ecology; phylogenetic analysis; virome","Microbiology","2019"
"20","Viral invasion fitness across a continuum from lysis to latency","Weitz, JS and Li, GL and Gulbudak, H and Cortez, MH and Whitaker, RJ","VIRUS EVOLUTION","The prevailing paradigm in ecological studies of viruses and their microbial hosts is that the reproductive success of viruses depends on the proliferation of the 'predator', that is, the virus particle. Yet, viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, and the virus genome-the actual unit of selection-can persist and proliferate from one cell generation to the next without lysis or the production of new virus particles. Here, we propose a theoretical framework to quantify the invasion fitness of viruses using an epidemiological cell-centric metric that focuses on the proliferation of viral genomes inside cells instead of virus particles outside cells. This cell-centric metric enables direct comparison of viral strategies characterized by obligate killing of hosts (e.g. via lysis), persistence of viral genomes inside hosts (e.g. via lysogeny), and strategies along a continuum between these extremes (e.g. via chronic infections). As a result, we can identify environmental drivers, life history traits, and key feedbacks that govern variation in viral propagation in nonlinear population models. For example, we identify threshold conditions given relatively low densities of susceptible cells and relatively high growth rates of infected cells in which lysogenic and other chronic strategies have higher potential viral reproduction than lytic strategies. Altogether, the theoretical framework helps unify the ongoing study of eco-evolutionary drivers of viral strategies in natural environments.","ecology; evolution; epidemiology; mathematical modeling; microbiology","Virology","2019"

The results demonstrated that most of the DNA viruses were dsDNA viruses (79.73-94.06%, except at PBI1, 37.51%). Of these, Caudovirales (Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae) phages were most abundant in surface seawater (67.67-71.99%), while nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) (Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae, and Pandoraviridae accounted for >30% of dsDNA viruses) were most abundant in the bottom water (3,357 mbs). Of the ssDNA viruses, Microviridae was the dominant family in PBI2, PBI3, PBOs, and PBI4b (57.09-87.55%), while Inoviridae (58.16%) was the dominant family in PBI1. Cellulophaga phages (phi38:1 and phi10:1) and Flavobacterium phage 11b, infecting the possible host strains affiliated with the family Flavobacteriaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes, were abundant in surface water dsDNA viromes. The long contig (PBI2_1_C) from the viral metagenomes were most similar to the genome architectures of Cellulophaga phage phi10:1 and Flavobacterium phage 11b from the Arctic Ocean. Comparative analysis showed that the surface viral community of Prydz Bay could be clearly separated from other marine and freshwater environments. The deep sea viral community was similar to the deep sea viral metagenome at A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment Station (ALOHA, at 22 degrees 45'N, 158 degrees 00'W). The multivariable analysis indicated that nutrients probably played an important role in shaping the local viral community structure. This study revealed the preliminary characteristics of the viral community in Prydz Bay, from both the surface and the deep sea.

However, the contribution of bacteriophages to the dissemination of resistance genes via transduction is rarely explored. In this study, we screened pig feces from three commercial farms in China for 32 clinically relevant ARC types to assess the presence of the ARG population in bacteria and bacteriophage and further to estimate the contribution of bacteriophages to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. We found that bacteriophage DNA contained 35.5% of the target ARG types and soil, bla(TEM) and ermB were found in 100% of the phage DNA samples. The most abundant genes in the bacterial population were ermB and fexA whereas ermB was the most abundant in bacteriophage. In contrast, floR was the least abundant ARG in both populations. Also, the ratio index of the abundance of ARGs in bacteriophage and bacteria was firstly used in this study as an estimator of bacteriophage ability to transmit ARGs. The ratio for qnrA was the greatest (about 10(-1)) and differed from the most abundant bacteriophage ARG ermB. In addition, fexA had the lowest ratio value (about 10(-6)) and not floR. These results illustrate that ARGs abundance and detection rates used alone probably be not suitable for comprehensively judging the contribution of bacteriophage to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. A more suitable model is the application of three indices; occurrence rate, absolute abundance in bacteriophage and the ratio value as warning and monitoring tools for environmental ARG assessments in bacteriophages.

The microbial activities along this continuum contribute substantially to global carbon and nutrient cycling, and yet there is a dearth of information on the diversity, abundance, and possible roles of viruses in this globally important river. The aim of this study was to elucidate the diversity and structure of virus assemblages of the Amazon River-ocean continuum. Environmental viral DNA sequences were obtained for 12 locations along the river's lower reach (n = 5) and plume (n = 7). Sequence assembly yielded 29,358 scaffolds, encoding 82,546 viral proteins, with 15 new complete viral genomes. Despite the spatial connectivity mediated by the river, virome analyses and physical-chemical water parameters clearly distinguished river and plume ecosystems. Bacteriophages were ubiquitous in the continuum and were more abundant in the transition region. Eukaryotic viruses occurred mostly in the river, while the plume had more viruses of autotrophic organisms (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus) and heterotrophic bacteria (Pelagibacter). The viral families Microviridae and Myoviridae were the most abundant and occurred throughout the continuum. The major functions of the genes in the continuum involved viral structures and life cycles, and viruses from plume locations and Tapajos River showed the highest levels of functional diversity. The distribution patterns of the viral assemblages were defined not only by the occurrence of possible hosts but also by water physical and chemical parameters, especially salinity. The findings presented here help to improve understanding of the possible roles of viruses in the organic matter cycle along the river-ocean continuum. IMPORTANCE The Amazon River forms a vast plume in the Atlantic Ocean that can extend for more than 1,000 km. Microbial communities promote a globally relevant carbon sink system in the plume. Despite the importance of viruses for the global carbon cycle, the diversity and the possible roles of viruses in the Amazon are poorly understood. The present work assesses, for the first time, the abundance and diversity of viruses simultaneously in the river and ocean in order to elucidate their possible roles. DNA sequence assembly yielded 29,358 scaffolds, encoding 82,546 viral proteins, with 15 new complete viral genomes from the 12 river and ocean locations. Viral diversity was clearly distinguished by river and ocean. Bacteriophages were the most abundant and occurred throughout the continuum. Viruses that infect eukaryotes were more abundant in the river, whereas phages appeared to have strong control over the host prokaryotic populations in the plume.","Amazon River; microbial communities; next-generation sequencing; river and ecology; river plume; virome","Microbiology","2017"

Infection and viral replication are disassociated in lysogens until an induction event such as DNA damage occurs, triggering viral-mediated lysis. The lysogen-lytic viral reproduction switch is central to viral ecology, with diverse ecosystem impacts. It has been argued that lysogeny is favoured in phages at low host densities. This paradigm is based on the fraction of chemically inducible cells (FCIC) lysogeny proxy determined using DNA-damaging mitomycin C inductions. Contrary to the established paradigm, a survey of 39 inductions publications found FCIC to be highly variable and pervasively insensitive to bacterial host density at global, within-environment and within-study levels. Attempts to determine the source(s) of variability highlighted the inherent complications in using the FCIC proxy in mixed communities, including dissociation between rates of lysogeny and FCIC values. Ultimately, FCIC studies do not provide robust measures of lysogeny or consistent evidence of either positive or negative host density dependence to the lytic-lysogenic switch. Other metrics are therefore needed to understand the drivers of the lytic-lysogenic decision in viral communities and to test models of the host density-dependent viral lytic-lysogenic switch.",NA,"Microbiology","2017"
"25","Inferring phage-bacteria infection networks from time-series data","Jover, LF and Romberg, J and Weitz, JS","Royal Society Open Science","In communities with bacterial viruses (phage) and bacteria, the phage-bacteria infection network establishes which virus types infect which host types. The structure of the infection network is a key element in understanding community dynamics. Yet, this infection network is often difficult to ascertain. Introduced over 60 years ago, the plaque assay remains the gold standard for establishing who infects whom in a community. This culture-based approach does not scale to environmental samples with increased levels of phage and bacterial diversity, much of which is currently unculturable. Here, we propose an alternative method of inferring phage-bacteria infection networks. This method uses time-series data of fluctuating population densities to estimate the complete interaction network without having to test each phage-bacteria pair individually. We use in silico experiments to analyse the factors affecting the quality of network reconstruction and find robust regimes where accurate reconstructions are possible. In addition, we present a multi-experiment approach where time series from different experiments are combined to improve estimates of the infection network. This approach also mitigates against the possibility of evolutionary changes to relevant phenotypes during the time course of measurement.","viral ecology; nonlinear dynamics; microbial ecology; complex and communities; inference","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2016"

We show that specific plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate with carbon export at 150 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted, oligotrophic ocean.

We find that two metrics of virion size (i.e. virion volume and genome length) decrease by about 55-fold as the temperature of occurrence increases from 0 to 40 degrees C. We also find that gene overlap increases exponentially with temperature, such that smaller viruses have proportionally greater gene overlap at higher temperatures.

Most studies of the microbiology of these ponds have focused on the abundance and removal efficiency of fecal indicator bacteria. Here we provide the first comprehensive study of microbial community diversity and activity in these ponds, and assess how different environmental and engineering factors influence these communities. Watershed land-use had no grouping effect on pond geochemistry or biology. Instead, we found that microbial community composition and activity were best explained by site-specific environmental variables. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that bacterial community structure varied greatly across sampled ponds, and appeared to be the result of autochthonous bacterial growth and not simply surface runoff. Metagenomic sequencing of pond viral communities suggested that viral taxa were influenced by external inputs, with viromes composed of bacteriophage that infect environmental bacteria, as well as viruses that infect eukaryotes and phages that infect bacteria pathogenic to eukaryotes.

To develop improved monitoring systems, a greater understanding of bacterial community structure, function, and variability across time is required in the context of different pollution types, such as agricultural and urban contamination. Here, we present a year long survey of free-living bacterial DNA collected from seven sites along rivers in three watersheds with varying land use in Southwestern Canada. This is the first study to examine the bacterial metagenome in flowing freshwater (lotic) environments over such a time span, providing an opportunity to describe bacterial community variability as a function of land use and environmental conditions. Characteristics of the metagenomic data, such as sequence composition and average genome size (AGS), vary with sampling site, environmental conditions, and water chemistry. For example, AGS was correlated with hours of daylight in the agricultural watershed and, across the agriculturally and urban-affected sites, k-mer composition clustering corresponded to nutrient concentrations. In addition to indicating a community shift, this change in AGS has implications in terms of the normalization strategies required, and considerations surrounding such strategies in general are discussed. When comparing abundances of gene functional groups between high- and low-quality water samples collected from an agricultural area, the latter had a higher abundance of nutrient metabolism and bacteriophage groups, possibly reflecting an increase in agricultural runoff. This work presents a valuable dataset representing a year of monthly sampling across watersheds and an analysis targeted at establishing a foundational understanding of how bacterial lotic communities vary across time and land use. The results provide important context for future studies, including further analyses of watershed ecosystem health, and the identification and development of biomarkers for improved water quality monitoring systems.","metagenomics; rivers; freshwater; land use; temporal variation; and normalization; bacteria","Microbiology","2015"

Environmental gradients develop within the column creating diverse niches that allow enrichment of specific bacteria. The enrichment culture can be used to study soil and sediment microbial community structure and function. In this study we used a 16S rRNA gene survey to characterize the microbial community dynamics during Winogradsky column development to determine the rate and extent of change from the source sediment community. Over a period of 60 days, the microbial community changed from the founding pond sediment population: Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, and Planctomycetes increased in relative abundance over time, while most Proteobacteria decreased in relative abundance. A unique, lightdependent surface biofilm community formed by 60 days that was less diverse and dominated by a few highly abundant bacteria. 67-72% of the surface community was comprised of highly enriched taxa that were rare in the source pond sediment, including the Cyanobacteria Anabaena, a member of the Gemmatimonadetes phylum, and a member of the Chloroflexi class Anaerolinea. This indicates that rare taxa can become abundant under appropriate environmental conditions and supports the hypothesis that rare taxa serve as a microbial seed bank. We also present preliminary findings that suggest that bacteriophages may be active in the Winogradsky community. The dynamics of certain taxa, most notably the Cyanobacteria, showed a bloom-and-decline pattern, consistent with bacteriophage predation as predicted in the kill-the-winner hypothesis. Time-lapse photography also supported the possibility of bacteriophage activity, revealing a pattern of colony clearance similar to formation of viral plaques.

To address these questions and improve comparative analysis of phages in different metagenomes, we screened a core set of publicly available metagenomic samples for sequences related to completely sequenced phages using the web tool, Phage Eco-Locator. We then adopted and deployed an array of mathematical and statistical metrics for a multidimensional estimation of the abundance and distribution of phage genes and genomes in various ecosystems. Experiments using those metrics individually showed their usefulness in emphasizing the pervasive, yet uneven, distribution of known phage sequences in environmental metagenomes. Using these metrics in combination allowed us to resolve phage genomes into clusters that correlated with their genotypes and taxonomic classes as well as their ecological properties.

Although sublethal concentrations are well known to select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, little is known about how bacterial evolution cascades through food webs, having indirect effect on species not directly affected by antibiotics (e.g. via population dynamics or pleiotropic effects). Here, we used an experimental evolution approach to test how temporal patterns of antibiotic stress, as well as migration within meta-populations, affect the evolution and ecology of microcosms containing one prey bacterium, one phage and two protist predators. We found that environmental variability, autocorrelation and migration had only subtle effects for population and evolutionary dynamics. However, unexpectedly, bacteria evolved greatest fitness increases to both antibiotics and enemies when the sublethal levels of antibiotics were highest, indicating positive pleiotropy. Crucially, bacterial adaptation cascaded through the food web leading to reduced predator-to-prey abundance ratio, lowered predator community diversity and increased instability of populations. Our results show that the presence of natural enemies can modify and even reverse the effects of antibiotics on bacteria, and that antibiotic selection can change the ecological properties of multitrophic microbial communities by having indirect effects on species not directly affected by antibiotics.","eco-evolutionary dynamics; environmental change; defence; diversity; and parasitism; predation","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & and Ecology; Evolutionary Biology","2015"

As with microbes however, there appear vast swaths of ""dark matter"" yet to be documented for viruses, even among relatively well studied viral types. Here, we use viromics to explore the ""Far-T4 phages"" sequence space, a neighbor clade from the well-studied T4-like phages that was first detected through PCR study in seawater and subsequently identified in freshwater lakes through 454-sequenced viromes. To advance the description of these viruses beyond this single marker gene, we explore Far-T4 genome fragments assembled from two deeply-sequenced freshwater viromes. Single gene phylogenetic trees confirm that the Far-T4 phages are divergent from the T4-like phages, genome fragments reveal largely collinear genome organizations, and both data led to the delineation of five Far 14 clades. Three-dimensional models of major capsid proteins are consistent with a 14-like structure, and highlight a highly conserved core flanked by variable insertions. Finally, we contextualize these now better characterized Far-T4 phages by re-analyzing 196 previously published viromes. These suggest that Far-T4 are common in freshwater and seawater as only four of 82 aquatic viromes lacked Far-T4-like sequences. Variability in representation across the five newly identified clades suggests clade-specific niche differentiation may be occurring across the different biomes, though the underlying mechanism remains unidentified. While complete genome assembly from complex communities and the lack of host linkage information still bottleneck virus discovery through viromes, these findings exemplify the power of metagenomics approaches to assess the diversity, evolutionary history, and genomic characteristics of novel uncultivated phages.","T4 phages; freshwater ecology; Caudovirales; capsid proteins; viral and genomes","Microbiology","2015"

Bacteriophage phi MAM1 was isolated on Serratia plymuthica A153, a biocontrol rhizosphere strain that produces the potently bioactive antifungal and anticancer haterumalide oocydin A. The phi MAM1 phage is a generalized transducing phage that infects multiple environmental and clinical isolates of Serratia spp. and a rhizosphere strain of Kluyvera cryocrescens. Electron microscopy allowed classification of phi MAM1 in the family Myoviridae.

We also demonstrated transduction of the complete 77-kb oocydin A gene cluster and heterogeneric transduction of a plasmid carrying a type III toxin-antitoxin system. These results support the notion of the potential ecological importance of transducing phages in the acquisition of genes by horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenetic analyses grouped phi MAM1 within the ViI-like bacteriophages, and genomic analyses revealed that the major differences between phi MAM1 and other ViI-like phages arise in a region encoding the host recognition determinants.

However, current results are ambiguous and the simultaneous impact of multiple ubiquitous enemies, protists and phages on virulence evolution has not been investigated previously. Here we tested experimentally how Tetrahymena thermophila protist predation and PNM phage parasitism (bacteria-specific virus) alone and together affect the evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 virulence, measured in wax moth larvae. Protist predation selected for small colony types, both in the absence and presence of phage, which showed decreased edibility to protists, reduced growth in the absence of enemies and attenuated virulence. Although phage selection alone did not affect the bacterial phenotype, it weakened protist-driven antipredatory defence (biofilm formation), its associated pleiotropic growth cost and the correlated reduction in virulence. These results suggest that protist selection can be a strong coincidental driver of attenuated bacterial virulence, and that phages can constrain this effect owing to effects on population dynamics and conflicting selection pressures. Attempting to define causal links such as these might help us to predict the cold and hot spots of coincidental virulence evolution on the basis of microbial community composition of environmental reservoirs.","coevolution; coincidental virulence; experimental evolution; disease and ecology; predation; trade-off","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology","2014"

The ecology of this pathogen outside its human host is largely unknown and one third of its annotated genes are still hypothetical. To identify genetic determinants expressed under a variety of environmental factors, we applied strand-specific RNA-sequencing, comparing the SOLiD and Illumina systems. Results: Transcriptomes of EHEC were sequenced under 11 different biotic and abiotic conditions: LB medium at pH4, pH7, pH9, or at 15 degrees C; LB with nitrite or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; LB-agar surface, M9 minimal medium, spinach leaf juice, surface of living radish sprouts, and cattle feces. Of 5379 annotated genes in strain EDL933 (genome and plasmid), a surprising minority of only 144 had null sequencing reads under all conditions. We therefore developed a statistical method to distinguish weakly transcribed genes from background transcription. We find that 96% of all genes and 91.5% of the hypothetical genes exhibit a significant transcriptional signal under at least one condition. Comparing SOLiD and Illumina systems, we find a high correlation between both approaches for fold-changes of the induced or repressed genes. The pathogenicity island LEE showed highest transcriptional activity in LB medium, minimal medium, and after treatment with antibiotics. Unique sets of genes, including many hypothetical genes, are highly up-regulated on radish sprouts, cattle feces, or in the presence of antibiotics. Furthermore, we observed induction of the shiga-toxin carrying phages by antibiotics and confirmed active biofilm related genes on radish sprouts, in cattle feces, and on agar plates. Conclusions: Since only a minority of genes (2.7%) were not active under any condition tested (null reads), we suggest that the assumption of significant genome over-annotations is wrong. Environmental transcriptomics uncovered hitherto unknown gene functions and unique regulatory patterns in EHEC. For instance, the environmental function of azoR had been elusive, but this gene is highly active on radish sprouts. Thus, NGS-transcriptomics is an appropriate technique to propose new roles of hypothetical genes and to guide future research.","EHEC; Radish sprouts; Cattle feces; Environment; Global transcriptome; and Next Generation Sequencing; SOLiD-Illumina comparison; Background and transcription; Hypothetical genes","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity","2014"
"39","Shotgun metagenomics indicates novel family A DNA polymerases predominate within marine virioplankton","Schmidt, HF and Sakowski, EG and Williamson, SJ and Polson, SW and Wommack, KE","ISME JOURNAL","Virioplankton have a significant role in marine ecosystems, yet we know little of the predominant biological characteristics of aquatic viruses that influence the flow of nutrients and energy through microbial communities. Family A DNA polymerases, critical to DNA replication and repair in prokaryotes, are found in many tailed bacteriophages. The essential role of DNA polymerase in viral replication makes it a useful target for connecting viral diversity with an important biological feature of viruses. Capturing the full diversity of this polymorphic gene by targeted approaches has been difficult; thus, full-length DNA polymerase genes were assembled out of virioplankton shotgun metagenomic sequence libraries (viromes). Within the viromes novel DNA polymerases were common and found in both double-stranded (ds) DNA and single-stranded (ss) DNA libraries. Finding DNA polymerase genes in ssDNA viral libraries was unexpected, as no such genes have been previously reported from ssDNA phage. Surprisingly, the most common virioplankton DNA polymerases were related to a siphovirus infecting an alpha-proteobacterial symbiont of a marine sponge and not the podoviral T7-like polymerases seen in many other studies. Amino acids predictive of catalytic efficiency and fidelity linked perfectly to the environmental clades, indicating that most DNA polymerase-carrying virioplankton utilize a lower efficiency, higher fidelity enzyme. Comparisons with previously reported, PCR-amplified DNA polymerase sequences indicated that the most common virioplankton metagenomic DNA polymerases formed a new group that included siphoviruses. These data indicate that slower-replicating, lytic or lysogenic phage populations rather than fast-replicating, highly lytic phages may predominate within the virioplankton.","viral ecology; metagenomics; phage diversity","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology","2014"
"40","Electrophoretic mobility confirms reassortment bias among geographic isolates of segmented RNA phages","Diaz-Munoz, SL and Tenaillon, O and Goldhill, D and Brao, K and Turner, PE and Chao, L","BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","Background: Sex presents evolutionary costs and benefits, leading to the expectation that the amount of genetic exchange should vary in conditions with contrasting cost-benefit equations. Like eukaryotes, viruses also engage in sex, but the rate of genetic exchange is often assumed to be a relatively invariant property of a particular virus. However, the rates of genetic exchange can vary within one type of virus according to geography, as highlighted by phylogeographic studies of cystoviruses. Here we merge environmental microbiology with experimental evolution to examine sex in a diverse set of cystoviruses, consisting of the bacteriophage phi 6 and its relatives. To quantify reassortment we manipulated by experimental evolution electrophoretic mobility of intact virus particles for use as a phenotypic marker to estimate genetic exchange. Results: We generated descendants of phi 6 that exhibited fast and slow mobility during gel electrophoresis. We identified mutations associated with slow and fast phenotypes using whole genome sequencing and used crosses to establish the production of hybrids of intermediate mobility. We documented natural variation in electrophoretic mobility among environmental isolates of cystoviruses and used crosses against a common fast mobility phi 6 strain to monitor the production of hybrids with intermediate mobility, thus estimating the amount of genetic exchange. Cystoviruses from different geographic locations have very different reassortment rates when measured against phi 6, with viruses isolated from California showing higher reassortment rates than those from the Northeastern US. Conclusions: The results confirm that cystoviruses from different geographic locations have remarkably different reassortment rates -despite similar genome structure and replication mechanisms-and that these differences are in large part due to sexual reproduction. This suggests that particular viruses may indeed exhibit diverse sexual behavior, but wide geographic sampling, across varying environmental conditions may be necessary to characterize the full repertoire. Variation in reassortment rates can assist in the delineation of viral populations and is likely to provide insight into important viral evolutionary dynamics including the rate of coinfection, virulence, and host range shifts. Electrophoretic mobility may be an indicator of important determinants of fitness and the techniques herein can be applied to the study of other viruses.","Sex; Population structure; Hybridization; Cooperation; Experimental and evolution; Ecology","Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity","2013"
"41","The episodic evolution of fibritin: traces of ancient global environmental alterations may remain in the genomes of T4-like phages","Letarov, AV and Krisch, HM","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","The evolutionary adaptation of bacteriophages to their environment is achieved by alterations of their genomes involving a combination of both point mutations and lateral gene transfer. A phylogenetic analysis of a large set of collar fiber protein (fibritin) loci from diverse T4-like phages indicates that nearly all the modular swapping involving the C-terminal domain of this gene occurred in the distant past and has since ceased. In phage T4, this fibritin domain encodes the sequence that mediates both the attachment of the long tail fibers to the virion and also controls, in an environmentally sensitive way, the phage's ability to infect its host bacteria. Subsequent to its distant period of modular exchange, the evolution of fibritin has proceeded primarily by the slow vertical divergence mechanism. We suggest that ancient and sudden changes in the environment forced the T4-like phages to alter fibritin's mode of action or function. The genome's response to such episodes of rapid environmental change could presumably only be achieved quickly enough by employing the modular evolution mechanism. A phylogenetic analysis of the fibritin locus reveals the possible traces of such events within the T4 superfamily's genomes.","Bacteriophage ecology; bacteriophage evolution; fibritin; modular and evolution; T4-like bacteriophages; whiskers","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology","2013"

However, our ability to understand and quantify phage-host interactions is technique-limited. Here, we introduce phageFISH -a markedly improved geneFISH protocol that increases gene detection efficiency from 40% to > 92% and is optimized for detection and visualization of intra-and extracellular phage DNA. The application of phageFISH to characterize infection dynamics in a marine podovirus-gammaproteobacterial host model system corroborated classical metrics (qPCR, plaque assay, FVIC, DAPI) and outperformed most of them to reveal new biology. PhageFISH detected both replicating and encapsidated (intracellular and extracellular) phage DNA, while simultaneously identifying and quantifying host cells during all stages of infection. Additionally, phageFISH allowed per-cell relative measurements of phage DNA, enabling single-cell documentation of infection status (e.g. early vs late stage infections). Further, it discriminated between two waves of infection, which no other measurement could due to population-averaged signals. Together, these findings richly characterize the infection dynamics of a novel model phage-host system, and debut phageFISH as a much-needed tool for studying phage-host interactions in the laboratory, with great promise for environmental surveys and lineage-specific population ecology of free phages.",NA,"Microbiology","2013"

The biomarker gene of g23, which encodes the major capsid protein of T4-type phages, was amplified with primers MZIA1bis and MZIA6, and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. In total, 96 and 50 different g23 clones were obtained from natural wetlands and a paddy field, respectively. A larger number of clones with low levels of identity to known sequences were found in water than in soil both in the natural wetlands and the paddy field, suggesting that many of T4-type phages in wetland water and paddy floodwater in Sanjiang plain are uncharacterized. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the g23 clones in natural wetlands, irrespective of water and soil, were distinctly different from those in marine waters, lake waters, and upland black soils, but were similar to those in paddy fields. The UniFrac analysis of g23 assemblages indicated that T4-type phage community compositions were different between soils and waters, and also were different between the natural wetlands and the paddy field. In general, the global analysis of g23 clone assemblages demonstrated that T4-type phage community compositions were different among natural wetlands, marines, lakes, paddy fields, and upland black soils.",NA,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; and Microbiology","2013"

While databases and resources for studying function in uncultured bacterial communities are relatively advanced, many fewer exist for their viral counterparts. The issue is largely technical in that the majority (often 90%) of viral sequences are functionally 'unknown' making viruses a virtually untapped resource of functional and physiological information. Here, we provide a community resource that organizes this unknown sequence space into 27 K high confidence protein clusters using 32 viral metagenomes from four biogeographic regions in the Pacific Ocean that vary by season, depth, and proximity to land, and include some of the first deep pelagic ocean viral metagenomes. These protein clusters more than double currently available viral protein clusters, including those from environmental datasets. Further, a protein cluster guided analysis of functional diversity revealed that richness decreased (i) from deep to surface waters, (ii) from winter to summer, (iii) and with distance from shore in surface waters only.

This phage is lytic for related Vibrio species of great ecological interest including the broadly antagonistic bacterium Vibrio sp. SWAT3 as well as notable members of the Harveyi clade (V. harveyi ATTC BAA-1116 and V. campbellii ATCC 25920). Vibrio phage SIO-2 has a circularly permuted genome of 80 598 bp, which displays unusual features. This genome is larger than that of most known siphoviruses and only 38 of the 116 predicted proteins had homologues in databases. Another divergence is manifest by the origin of core genes, most of which share robust similarities with unrelated viruses and bacteria spanning a wide range of phyla. These core genes are arranged in the same order as in most bacteriophages but they are unusually interspaced at two places with insertions of DNA comprising a high density of uncharacterized genes. The acquisition of these DNA inserts is associated with morphological variation of SIO-2 capsid, which assembles as a large (80 nm) shell with a novel T = 12 symmetry. These atypical structural features confer on SIO-2 a remarkable stability to a variety of physical, chemical and environmental factors. Given this high level of functional and genomic novelty, SIO-2 emerges as a model of considerable interest in ecological and evolutionary studies.",NA,"Microbiology","2012"

Viruses modulate host cell abundance and diversity, contribute to the cycling of nutrients, alter host cell phenotype, and influence the evolution of both host cell and viral communities through the lateral transfer of genes (3). Numerous studies have highlighted the staggering genetic diversity of viruses and their functional potential in a variety of natural environments. Metagenomic techniques have been used to study the taxonomic diversity and functional potential of complex viral assemblages whose members contain single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and RNA genotypes (4-9). Current library construction protocols used to study environmental DNA-containing or RNA-containing viruses require an initial nuclease treatment in order to remove nontargeted templates (10). However, a comprehensive understanding of the collective gene complement of the virus community and virus diversity requires knowledge of all members regardless of genome composition. Fractionation of purified nucleic acid subtypes provides an effective mechanism by which to study viral assemblages without sacrificing a subset of the community's genetic signature. Hydroxyapatite, a crystalline form of calcium phosphate, has been employed in the separation of nucleic acids, as well as proteins and microbes, since the 1960s(11). By exploiting the charge interaction between the positively-charged Ca2+ ions of the hydroxyapatite and the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid subtypes, it is possible to preferentially elute each nucleic acid subtype independent of the others. We recently employed this strategy to independently fractionate the genomes of ssDNA, dsDNA and RNA-containing viruses in preparation of DNA sequencing (12). Here, we present a method for the fractionation and recovery of ssDNA, dsDNA and RNA viral nucleic acids from mixed viral assemblages using hydroxyapatite chromotography.","Immunology; Issue 55; Hydroxyapatite; single-stranded DNA; and double-stranded DNA; RNA; DNA; chromatography; viral ecology; virus; and bacteriophage","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2011"

The origins of DNA polymerase gamma have remained elusive because it is not present in any known bacterium, though it has been hypothesized that mitochondria may have inherited the enzyme by phage-mediated nonorthologous displacement.

Phylogenetic analyses of these phage DNA polymerase gamma proteins show that they branch deeply within the DNA polymerase gamma clade and therefore share a common origin with their eukaryotic homologues. We also found homologues of these phage polymerases in the environmental Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis (CAMERA) database, which fell in the same clade. An analysis of the CAMERA assemblies containing the environmental homologues together with the filter fraction metadata indicated some of these assemblies may be of bacterial origin. We also show that the phage-encoded DNA polymerase gamma is highly transcribed as the phage genomes are replicated. These findings provide data that may assist in reconstructing the evolution of mitochondria.","Acaryochloris; cyanophage; evolution; mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & and Heredity","2011"

Other filters with small pore sizes exist, including the 13 mm Anodisc (TM) membranes without a support ring. However, the use of these membranes for viral enumeration has not been previously reported. Results: Here we describe a modified protocol for 13 mm Anodisc membranes that uses a custom filter holder that can be readily constructed in individual investigators' laboratories from commercially available Swinnex (R) filter holders. We compared VLP concentrations obtained from phage lysates and seawater samples using both Anodisc membranes, as well as Nuclepore (TM) small pore-size membranes (0.015 or 0.030 mu m). The 13 mm Anodisc membranes gave comparable estimates of VLP abundance to those obtained with the 25 mm Anodisc membranes when similar staining methods were employed. Both Nuclepore membranes typically gave an order of magnitude lower VLP abundance values for environmental samples. Conclusions: The 13 mm Anodisc membranes are less costly and require smaller sample volumes than their 25 mm counterpart making them ideal for large-scale studies and sample replication. This method increases the options of reliable approaches available for quantifying VLP from environmental samples.",NA,"Microbiology","2011"

Viral abundance (VA) and viral production (VP) were monitored in the Chesapeake Bay over 4 1/2 annual cycles, producing a unique, long-term, interannual study of virioplankton production. High and dynamic VP rates, averaging 7.9 x 10(6) viruses per mL per h, indicate that viral lysis impacts a significant fraction of microorganisms in the Chesapeake. Viral-mediated bacterial mortality, VA, VP, and organic carbon release all displayed similar interannual and seasonal trends with higher values in 2003 and 2006 than in 2004 and 2005 and peaks in early spring and summer. Surprisingly, higher rates of viral lysis occurred in winter, resulting in a magnified effect of viral lysis on bacterioplankton during times of reduced productivity. Viral lysis directly impacted the organic carbon pool, contributing on average 76 mu g of C per L per d, an amount capable of sustaining similar to 55% of Chesapeake Bay bacterial production. The observed repeating interannual patterns of VP and lysis are likely interlinked with seasonal cycles of host abundance and diversity, which are in turn driven by annual cycles in environmental conditions, emphasizing the complex interplay of seasonality and microbial ecology in the Chesapeake Bay.","viral ecology; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; bacteriophage; tangential and flow diafiltration","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2011"

At the same time, viral metagenomes could also represent a potential source of recombinant proteins with biotechnological value. In order to identify such proteins, a novel two-step screening technique was devised for cloning phage lytic enzymes from uncultured viral DNA. This plasmid-based approach first involves a primary screen in which transformed Escherichia coli clones that demonstrate colony lysis following exposure to inducing agent are identified. This effect, which can be due to the expression of membrane-permeabilizing phage holins, is discerned by the development a hemolytic effect in surrounding blood agar. In a secondary step, the clones identified in the primary screen are overlaid with autoclaved Gram-negative bacteria (specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to assay directly for recombinant expression of lytic enzymes, which are often encoded proximally to holins in phage genomes. As proof-ofprinciple, the method was applied to a viral metagenomic library constructed from mixed animal feces, and 26 actively expressed lytic enzymes were cloned. These proteins include both Gram-positive-like and Gram-negative-like enzymes, as well as several atypical lysins whose predicted structures are less common among known phage.

The possible virulence implications of microbial warfare among multiple co-infecting strains are diverse. Killing competitors can reduce virulence by reducing overall microbial densities, or increase virulence if for example the allelopathic mechanism involves immuno-manipulation. Finally, we place microbial anti-competitor strategies in a social evolution framework, highlighting how costly anti-competitor strategies can be understood as examples of microbial spite.

The relative infective titers of HaSNPV and CrPV were unchanged or slightly reduced in the presence of different minerals compared to their titers in the absence of the mineral. In contrast, the infective titer of IIV-6 varied according to the mineral being tested. In adsorption studies, over 98% of HaSNPV occlusion bodies were adsorbed by all the minerals, and a particularly high affinity was observed with ferric oxide, attapulgite, and kaolinite. In contrast, the adsorption of CrPV and IIV-6 differed markedly with mineral type, with low affinity to bentonites and high affinity to ferric oxide and kaolinite. We conclude that interactions between soil-formirig minerals and insect viruses appear to be most important in nucleopolyhedroviruses, followed by invertebrate iridescent viruses, and least important in CrPV, which may reflect the ecology of these pathogens. Moreover, soils with a high content of iron oxides or kaolinite would likely represent highly effective reservoirs for insect-pathogenic viruses.",NA,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2006"

Some newly isolated bacteriophages grow so poorly that they appear inaccessible to liquid enrichment culture.

Insect vectors, like all other organisms, are colonized by a community of various microorganisms, which can influence their physiology, ecology, evolution, and also their competence as vectors. The important ecological meaning of bacteriophages in various ecosystems and their role in microbial communities has emerged in the past decade. However, only a few phages have been described so far in insect microbiomes. The leafhopper Euscelidius variegatus is a laboratory vector of the phytoplasma causing Flavescence doree, a severe grapevine disease that threatens viticulture in Europe. Here, the presence of a temperate bacteriophage in E. variegatus (named Euscelidius variegatus phage 1, EVP-1) was revealed through both insect transcriptome analyses and electron microscopic observations. The bacterial host was isolated in axenic culture and identified as the bacterial endosymbiont of E. variegatus (BEV), recently assigned to the genus Candidatus Symbiopectobacterium. BEV harbors multiple prophages that become active in culture, suggesting that different environments can trigger different mechanisms, finely regulating the interactions among phages. Understanding the complex relationships within insect vector microbiomes may help in revealing possible microbe influences on pathogen transmission, and it is a crucial step toward innovative sustainable strategies for disease management in agriculture.","microbiome; bacteriophages; insect vectors; Euscelidius variegatus; and phytoplasma; Flavescence doree; transcriptome; electron microscopy","Microbiology","2021"

Ongoing research seeks to gain novel insights on the microbial ecology of such environments, in order to further the understanding of life adaptation to extreme conditions. To this aim, the abundance of prokaryotic cells (including cell morphologies and size for biomass conversion), the amount of viable cells (in terms of membrane-intact cells and respiring cells), the viral count, the physiological profiles at community level and the main microbial enzymatic activities were described. The brines differed each other in terms of prokaryotic cells' abundance, size, and viability as well as viral abundance. Cell morphotypes and metabolic responses also varied among the brine samples. Underground interconnections were likely to occur, with the microbial community becoming more abundant and structured to better exploit the limited resource availability. Overall, complex interactions among multiple environmental factors, including marine water origin, depth horizon, isolation time of the brines, and climatic variations, reflected on the microbial community distribution patterns and highlighted the need to preserve these niches of extreme life.","Prokaryotes; Viruses; Metabolic potentials; Brines; Antarctica","Marine & Freshwater Biology","2021"

Viruses impact microbial diversity, gene flow and function through virus-host interactions. Although metagenomics surveys are rapidly cataloguing viral diversity, methods are needed to capture specific virus-host interactions in situ. Here, we leveraged metagenomics and repurposed emulsion paired isolation-concatenation PCR (epicPCR) to investigate viral diversity and virus-host interactions in situ over time in an estuarine environment. The method fuses a phage marker, the ribonucleotide reductase gene, with the host 16S rRNA gene of infected bacterial cells within emulsion droplets providing single-cell resolution for dozens of samples. EpicPCR captured in situ virus-host interactions for viral clades with no closely related database representatives. Abundant freshwater Actinobacteria lineages, in particular Rhodoluna sp., were the most common hosts for these poorly characterized viruses, with interactions correlated with environmental factors. Multiple methods used to identify virus-host interactions, including epicPCR, identified different and largely non-overlapping interactions within the vast virus-host interaction space. Tracking virus-host interaction dynamics also revealed that multi-host viruses had significantly longer periods with observed virus-host interactions, whereas single-host viruses were observed interacting with hosts at lower minimum abundances, suggesting more efficient interactions. Capturing in situ interactions with epicPCR revealed environmental and ecological factors shaping virus-host interactions, highlighting epicPCR as a valuable technique in viral ecology.",NA,"Microbiology","2021"
"62","A Novel Group of Promiscuous Podophages Infecting Diverse Gammaproteobacteria from River Communities Exhibits Dynamic Intergenus Host Adaptation","Cazares, D and Cazares, A and Figueroa, W and Guarneros, G and Edwards, RA and Vinuesa, P","MSYSTEMS","Phages are generally described as species specific or even strain specific, implying an inherent limitation for some to be maintained and spread in diverse bacterial communities. Moreover, phage isolation and host range determination rarely consider the phage ecological context, likely biasing our notion on phage specificity. Here we isolated and characterized a novel group of six promiscuous phages, named Atoyac, existing in rivers and sewage by using a diverse collection of over 600 bacteria retrieved from the same environments as potential hosts. These podophages isolated from different regions in Mexico display a remarkably broad host range, infecting bacteria from six genera: Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Yersinia, Hafnia, Escherichia, and Serratia. Atoyac phage genomes are similar to 42 kb long and highly similar to each other, but not to those currently available in genome and metagenome public databases. Detailed comparison of the phages' efficiency of plating (EOP) revealed variation among bacterial genera, implying a cost associated with infection of distant hosts, and between phages, despite their sequence similarity. We show, through experimental evolution in single or alternate hosts of different genera, that efficiency of plaque production is highly dynamic and tends toward optimization in hosts rendering low plaque formation. However, adaptation to distinct hosts differed between similar phages; whereas one phage optimized its EOP in all tested hosts, the other reduced plaque production in one host, suggesting that propagation in multiple bacteria may be key to maintain promiscuity in some viruses. Our study expands our knowledge of the virosphere and uncovers bacteriumphage interactions overlooked in natural systems. IMPORTANCE In natural environments, phages coexist and interact with a broad variety of bacteria, posing a conundrum for narrow-host-range phage maintenance in diverse communities. This context is rarely considered in the study of host-phage interactions, typically focused on narrow-host-range viruses and their infectivity in target bacteria isolated from sources distinct to where the phages were retrieved from. By studying phage-host interactions in bacteria and viruses isolated from river microbial communities, we show that novel phages with promiscuous host range encompassing multiple bacterial genera can be found in the environment. Assessment of hundreds of interactions in diverse hosts revealed that similar phages exhibit different infection efficiency and adaptation patterns. Understanding host range is fundamental in our knowledge of bacterium-phage interactions and their impact on microbial communities. The dynamic nature of phage promiscuity revealed in our study has implications in different aspects of phage research such as horizontal gene transfer or phage therapy.","bacteriophages; environmental microbiology; experimental evolution; and microbial ecology; phage-bacterium interactions","Microbiology","2021"

Ideally, the investigation of emergence in plant viruses requires examining the population dynamics of both virus and host, their interactions with each other, with other organisms and the abiotic environment. Genetic mechanisms that affect demographic processes are now being studied with high-throughput technologies, traditional genetics methods, and new computational tools for big-data. In this review, we discuss the utility of these approaches to monitor and detect changes in virus populations within cells and individuals, and over wider areas across species and communities of ecosystems. The advent of genomics in virology has fostered a multidisciplinary approach to tackling disease risk The ability to make sense of the information now generated in this integrated setting is by far the most substantial obstacle to the ultimate goal of plant virology to minimize the threats to food security posed by disease.

Mosquito larvae were collected using standard dippers and pipettes. Egg survivorship in dry soil was evaluated by collecting soil samples from dry potential larval developmental sites, re-hydrating them for hatching and rearing of the eventual larvae to adults. Adult mosquitoes were collected with CDC light traps and BG-Sentinel traps. All blood-fed females were tested for bloodmeal origin. Mosquitoes were screened for arboviruses using RT-qPCR. Overall, the predominant species were Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) 72.4% (n = 2,364) and Aedes aegypti (L.), 25.7%, (n = 838). A total of 415 larval developmental sites were identified indoors (n = 317) and outdoors (n = 98). The most productive larval developmental sites, both indoors and outdoors, were assorted small containers, water tanks, drainages, drums, and jerricans. Overall, 62% (n = 18) of the soil samples collected were positive for larvae which were used as a proxy to measure the presence of eggs. The mosquitoes fed on humans (29.8%) and chickens (3.7%). Of 259 mosquitoes tested for viral infection, 11.6% were positive for Flavivirus only. The most productive larval developmental sites for arboviral vectors indoors were small containers, water tanks, jerricans, and drums whereas small containers, water tanks, drainage channels, buckets, tires, and water troughs were the productive larval developmental sites outdoors.","Aedes; Culex; arbovirus; ecology","Entomology; Veterinary Sciences","2021"

In this study, a NNV strain CNPgg2018 isolated from pearl gentian grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus male x Epinephelus fuscoguttatu female) juveniles was identified and characterized by histopathology examination, transmission electron microscopic (TEM), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus culture, phylogenetic analysis and experimental infection. The results showed that the diseased fish exhibited symptoms with loss of appetite, darkened body and abnormal swimming behavior. Histopathological examination revealed widespread diffuse vacuolation degeneration appeared in the brain, retina and peripheral nerve tissues. TEM observation showed that numerous virions with a diameter of about 25 nm scattered around the retinal vacuolation. Significant cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed in striped snakehead (SSN-1) and grouper brain (GB) cell lines, not in Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE-214), epithelioma papillosum cyprini (EPC) and fat-head minnow (FHM) cell lines after inoculation of pathological tissue homogenates.

Understanding the mechanisms that bacteriophages implement to infect their hosts will allow researchers to manipulate these systems and adapt them to specific bacterial targets. In this study, we isolated a bacteriophage capable of infecting the marine alphaproteobacterium Phaeobacter inhibens and determined its mechanism of infection. Phaeobacter virus MD18, a novel species of bacteriophage isolated in Woods Hole, MA, exhibits potent lytic ability against P. inhibens and appears to be of the Siphoviridae morphotype. The genomic sequence of MD18 displayed significant similarity to another siphophage, the recently discovered Roseobacter phage DSS3P8, but genomic and phylogenetic analyses, assessing host range and a search of available metagenomes are all consistent with the conclusion that Phaeobacter phage MD18 is a novel lytic phage. We incubated MD18 with a library of barcoded P. inhibens transposon insertion mutants and identified 22 genes that appear to be required for phage predation of this host. Network analysis of these genes using genomic position, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment, and protein associations revealed that these genes are enriched for roles in assembly of a type IV pilus (T4P) and regulators of cellular morphology. Our results suggest that T4P serve as receptors for a novel marine virus that targets P. inhibens. IMPORTANCE Bacteriophages are useful nonantibiotic therapeutics for bacterial infections as well as threats to industries utilizing bacterial agents. This study identified Phaeobacter virus MD18, a phage antagonist of Phaeobacter inhibens, a bacterium with promising use as a probiotic for aquatic farming industries. Genomic analysis suggested that Phaeobacter phage MD18 has evolved to enhance its replication in P. inhibens by adopting favorable tRNA genes as well as through genomic sequence adaptation to resemble host codon usage. Lastly, a high-throughput analysis of P. inhibens transposon insertion mutants identified genes that modulate host susceptibility to phage MD18 and implicated the type IV pilus as the likely receptor recognized for adsorption. This study marks the first characterization of the relationship between P. inhibens and an environmentally sampled phage, which informs our understanding of natural threats to the bacterium and may promote the development of novel phage technologies for genetic manipulation of this host.","bacteriophage; BarSeq; ecology; microbial interactions; phage genomics","Microbiology","2020"

Even in the omics age, cultivation is an essential discipline in microbial ecology since microbial cultures are necessary to assess the validity of an in silico prediction about the microbial metabolism and to isolate viruses infecting bacteria and archaea. However, the ecophysiological characteristics of predominant freshwater bacterial lineages remain largely unknown due to the scarcity of cultured representatives. In an ongoing effort to cultivate the uncultured majority of freshwater bacteria, the most abundant freshwater Actinobacteria acI clade has recently been cultivated from Lake Soyang through catalase-supplemented high-throughput cultivation based on dilution-to-extinction. This method involves physical isolation of target microbes from mixed populations, culture media simulating natural habitats, and removal of toxic compounds. In this protocol, we describe detailed procedures for isolating freshwater oligotrophic microbes, as well as the essence of the dilution-to-extinction culturing. As a case study employing the catalase-supplemented dilution-to-extinction protocol, we also report a cultivation trial using a water sample collected from Lake Soyang. Of the 480 cultivation wells inoculated with a single lake-water sample, 75 new acI strains belonging to 8 acI tribes (acI-A1, A2, A4, A5, A6, A7, B1, B4, C1, and C2) were cultivated, and each representative strain per subclade could be revived from glycerol stocks. These cultivation results demonstrate that the protocol described in this study is efficient in isolating freshwater bacterioplankton harboring streamlined genomes.","dilution-to-extinction; cultivation; high-throughput culturing; and freshwater; catalase; acI bacteria; Candidatus Planktophila","Microbiology","2020"

Although Nanoparticle tracking analysis combined with gentle staining at 30 degrees C could be confirmed by this study to be a reliable quantification technique for tested environmental samples, environmental samples still lack an universally applicable and accurate quantification method. Special attention has to be put on optimal sample concentrations as well as optimized sample preparations, which are specific for each method.

The underlying genetic mechanisms of the processes governing thrips pest and vector biology, feeding behaviors, ecology, and insecticide resistance are largely unknown. To address this gap, we present theF. occidentalisdraft genome assembly and official gene set. Results We report on the first genome sequence for any member of the insect order Thysanoptera. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog (BUSCO) assessments of the genome assembly (size = 415.8 Mb, scaffold N50 = 948.9 kb) revealed a relatively complete and well-annotated assembly in comparison to other insect genomes. The genome is unusually GC-rich (50%) compared to other insect genomes to date. The official gene set (OGS v1.0) contains 16,859 genes, of which similar to 10% were manually verified and corrected by our consortium. We focused on manual annotation, phylogenetic, and expression evidence analyses for gene sets centered on primary themes in the life histories and activities of plant-colonizing insects. Highlights include the following: (1) divergent clades and large expansions in genes associated with environmental sensing (chemosensory receptors) and detoxification (CYP4, CYP6, and CCE enzymes) of substances encountered in agricultural environments; (2) a comprehensive set of salivary gland genes supported by enriched expression; (3) apparent absence of members of the IMD innate immune defense pathway; and (4) developmental- and sex-specific expression analyses of genes associated with progression from larvae to adulthood through neometaboly, a distinct form of maturation differing from either incomplete or complete metamorphosis in the Insecta. Conclusions Analysis of theF. occidentalisgenome offers insights into the polyphagous behavior of this insect pest that finds, colonizes, and survives on a widely diverse array of plants. The genomic resources presented here enable a more complete analysis of insect evolution and biology, providing a missing taxon for contemporary insect genomics-based analyses.

To study factors that contribute to microbial community assembly, we examined the temporal dynamics of genes in five aquatic metagenome time-series, originating from marine offshore or coastal sites and one lake. With this trait-based approach we expected to find gene-specific patterns of temporal allele variability that depended on the seasonal metacommunity size of carrier-taxa and the variability of the milieu and the substrates to which the resulting proteins were exposed. In more detail, we hypothesized that a larger seasonal metacommunity size would result in increased temporal variability of functional units (i.e., gene alleles), as shown previously for taxonomic units. We further hypothesized that multicopy genes would feature higher temporal variability than single-copy genes, as gene multiplication can result from high variability in substrate quality and quantity. Finally, we hypothesized that direct exposure of proteins to the extracellular environment would result in increased temporal variability of the respective gene compared to intracellular proteins that are less exposed to environmental fluctuations. The first two hypotheses were confirmed in all data sets, while significant effects of the subcellular location of gene products was only seen in three of the five time-series. The gene with the highest allele variability throughout all data sets was an iron transporter, also representing a target for phage infection. Previous work has emphasized the role of phage-prokaryote interactions as a major driver of microbial diversity. Our finding therefore points to a potentially important role of iron transporter-mediated phage infections for the assembly and maintenance of diversity in aquatic prokaryotes.","community ecology; ecological genetics; marine environments; and metagenomics; microbial ecology; time-series","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; and Evolutionary Biology","2020"

Here, we analyzed the composition of non-eukaryotic DNA associated with individual cells of small, planktonic protists in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) and the Mediterranean Sea. We found viral DNA associated with a substantial fraction cells from the GoM (51%) and the Mediterranean Sea (35%). While Mediterranean SAGs contained a larger proportion of cells containing bacterial sequences (49%), a smaller fraction of cells contained bacterial sequences in the GoM (19%). In GoM cells, nearly identical bacteriophage and ssDNA virus sequences where found across diverse lineages of protists, suggesting many of these viruses are non-infective. The fraction of cells containing viral DNA varied among protistan lineages and reached 100% in Picozoa and Choanozoa. These two groups also contained significantly higher numbers of viral sequences than other identified taxa. We consider mechanisms that may explain the presence of viral DNA in protistan cells and conclude that protistan predation on free viral particles contributed to the observed patterns. These findings confirm prior experiments with protistan isolates and indicate that the viral shunt is complemented by a viral link in the marine microbial food web. This link may constitute a sink of viral particles in the ocean and has implications for the flow of carbon through the microbial food web.","nanoeukaryote; marine eukaryote; virus; phage; microbial ecology; marine and food web; protist","Microbiology","2020"

We paired large-scale dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation with microbial community analysis and modeling to expand the phylogenetic and geographic diversity of cultivated bacterioplankton and to evaluate DTE cultivation success. Here, we report results from 17 DTE experiments totaling 7,820 individual incubations over 3 years, yielding 328 repeatably transferable isolates. Comparison of isolates to microbial community data for source waters indicated that we successfully isolated 5% of the observed bacterioplankton community throughout the study; 43% and 26% of our isolates matched operational taxonomic units and amplicon single-nucleotide variants, respectively, within the top 50 most abundant taxa. Isolates included those from previously uncultivated clades such as SAR 1 LD12 and Actinobacteria aclV, as well as geographically novel members from other ecologically important groups like SAR11 subclade IIla, SAR116, and others, providing isolates in eight putatively new genera and seven putatively new species. Using a newly developed DTE cultivation model, we evaluated taxon viability by comparing relative abundance with cultivation success. The model (i) revealed the minimum attempts required for successful isolation of taxa amenable to growth on our media and (ii) identified possible subpopulation viability variation in abundant taxa such as SAR11 that likely impacts cultivation success. By incorporating viability in experimental design, we can now statistically constrain the effort necessary for successful cultivation of specific taxa on a defined medium. IMPORTANCE Even before the coining of the term ""great plate count anomaly"" in the 1980s, scientists had noted the discrepancy between the number of microorganisms observed under the microscope and the number of colonies that grew on traditional agar media. New cultivation approaches have reduced this disparity, resulting in the isolation of some of the ""most wanted"" bacterial lineages. Nevertheless, the vast majority of microorganisms remain uncultured, hampering progress toward answering fundamental biological questions about many important microorganisms. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated the underlying factors influencing cultivation success, limiting our ability to improve cultivation efficacy. Our work details the use of dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation to expand the phylogenetic and geographic diversity of available axenic cultures. We also provide a new model of the DTE approach that uses cultivation results and natural abundance information to predict taxon-specific viability and iteratively constrain DTE experimental design to improve cultivation success.","dilution to extinction; cultivation; bacterioplankton; LSUCC; microbial and ecology; coastal microbiology","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2020"

Examples are abiotic niches such as detrital particles that show different sizes and organic contents, and biotic niches resulting from bacteria-phage and bacteria-phytoplankton interactions. A common practice to investigate the impact of microenvironments on bacterial evolution is to separate the microenvironments physically and compare the bacterial inhabitants from each. It remains poorly understood, however, which microenvironment primarily drives bacterioplankton evolution in the pelagic ocean. By applying a dilution cultivation approach to an undisturbed coastal water sample, we isolate a bacterial population affiliated with the globally dominantRoseobactergroup. Although varying at just a few thousand nucleotide sites across the whole genomes, members of this clonal population are diverging into two genetically separated subspecies. Genes underlying speciation are not unique to subspecies but instead clustered at the shared regions that represent similar to 6% of the genomic DNA. They are primarily involved in vitamin synthesis, motility, oxidative defense, carbohydrate, and amino acid utilization, consistent with the known strategies that roseobacters take to interact with phytoplankton and particles. Physiological assays corroborate that one subspecies outcompetes the other in these traits.

To better understand marine primary productivity, details of the relationship between viruses and their diatom hosts must be elucidated. The marine diatomChaetoceros debilisis a cosmopolitan species and its blooms are often observed in highly productive areas. To date, onlyC. debilisDNA virus (CdebDNAV) has been isolated and characterized. In this study, we successfully identified a previously unknown virus-like particle (VLP) and ssDNA molecules co-occurring with CdebDNAV. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the cytoplasm of infectedC. debilisrevealed particles that were 21 and 36 nm in size, corresponding to the newly identified VLPs and CdebDNAV, respectively. The ssDNA molecules encode a putative capsid protein (CP); however, no proteins related to replication were detected. The estimated molecular weight of the CP is 24.4 kDa, similar to that of VLPs in the protein electrophoresis analysis. Genetic analyses revealed that the CP shows low levels of similarity with uncultured marine ssDNA viruses, but seems to be independent of the known virus genera. Although the relationships between the smaller VLP and ssDNA molecules identified in this study were not fully revealed, it might be a new virus. The finding is important for understanding diatom virus ecology and to promote further characterization of uncultured aquatic ssDNA viruses.","algal virus; Chaetoceros debilis; diatom; ssDNA; sub-viral agent","Marine & Freshwater Biology","2020"

They mostly lack the two major virulence factors of toxigenicV. choleraeserogroups O1 and O139 strains, which are the causative agent of cholera. Non-O1, non-O139 strains are found in water bodies, sediments, and in association with other aquatic organisms. Occurrence of these bacteria in fecal specimens of waterfowl were reported, and migratory birds likely contribute to the long-distance transfer of strains. We investigated fourV. choleraenon-O1, non-O139 isolates for phenotypic traits and by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The isolates were recovered from organs of domestic ducks with serious disease symptoms. WGS data revealed only a distant genetic relationship between all isolates. The isolates harbored a number of virulence factors found in mostV. choleraestrains. Specific virulence factors of non-O1, non-O139 strains, such as the type III secretion system (TTSS) or cholix toxin, were observed. An interesting observation is that all isolates possess multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin toxins (MARTX) closely related to the MARTX of toxigenic El Tor O1 strains. Different primary sequences of the abundant OmpU proteins could indicate a significant role of this virulence factor. Phenotypic characteristics such as hemolysis and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were studied. Three isolates showed susceptibility to a number of tested antimicrobials, and one strain possessed AMR genes located in an integron. Knowledge of the environmental occurrence ofV. choleraenon-O1, non-O139 in Germany is limited. The source of the infection of the ducks is currently unknown. In the context of the 'One Health' concept, it is desirable to study the ecology ofV. choleraenon-O1, non-O139, as it cannot be excluded that the isolates possess zoonotic potential and could cause infections in humans.","diseased birds; virulence factors; phylogenetic analysis; antimicrobial and resistance","Microbiology","2020"

Following the observation of cytopathic effect in a striped-snakehead fish cell line, 35-nm virions with flaviviral morphology were visualized using electron microcopy. Next-generation sequencing and rapid amplification of cDNA ends obtained the complete genome. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed the presence of viral RNA in formalin-fixed tissues from the wild salmon. For the first time, in vivo replication of an aquatic flavivirus was demonstrated following intracoelomic injection in a Chinook salmon model of infection. RT-qPCR demonstrated viral replication in salmon brains up to 15 days postinjection. Infectious virus was then reisolated in culture, fulfilling Rivers' postulates. Only limited replication occurred in the kidneys of Chinook salmon or in tissues of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The proposed salmon flavivirus (SFV) has a 10.3-kb genome that encodes a rare dual open reading frame, a feature uncharacteristic of classical flaviviruses. Phylogenetic analysis places SFV in a basal position among a new subgroup of recently recognized aquatic and bat flaviviruses distinct from the established mosquito-borne, tick-borne, insect-only, and unknown-vector flavivirus groups. While the pathogenic potential of the virus remains to be fully elucidated, its basal phylogeny and the in vivo infection model will allow SFV to serve as a prototype for aquatic flaviviruses. Ongoing field and laboratory studies will facilitate better understanding of the potential impacts of SFV infection on ecologically and economically important salmonid species. IMPORTANCE Chinook salmon are a keystone fish species of great ecological and commercial significance in their native northern Pacific range and in regions to which they have been introduced. Threats to salmon populations include habitat degradation, climate change, and infectious agents, including viruses. While the first isolation of a flavivirus from wild migrating salmon may indicate an emerging disease threat, characterization of the genome provides insights into the ecology and long evolutionary history of this important group of viruses affecting humans and other animals and into an expanding group of recently discovered aquatic flaviviruses.","aquatic; flavivirus; novel; salmon","Virology","2020"

Each are rapid-turnaround, highly-specific (showing no detection of non-Ebola strains), sensitive and portable. These assays are ideally placed for field-use during outbreaks in low-resource countries and equally suited to use as conventional high-throughput laboratory tests. They encompass a colourimetric option with easy-to-interpret pink-to-yellow colour-change visualisation and real-time detection formats allowing the approximation of virus copy number, which helps monitoring of virus levels during infection. The inclusion of a probe-based detection method also leaves the door open for multi-pathogen detection, which could be useful for future VHF outbreaks, where the cause is unknown. Background The unprecedented 2013/16 outbreak ofZaire ebolavirus(Ebola virus) in West Africa has highighted the need for rapid, high-throughput and POC diagnostic assays to enable timely detection and appropriate triaging of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) patients. Ebola virus is highly infectious and prompt diagnosis and triage is crucial in preventing further spread within community and healthcare settings. Moreover, due to the ecology of Ebola virus it is important that newly developed diagnostic assays are suitable for use in both the healthcare environment and low resource rural locations. Methodology/Principle findings A LAMP assay was successfully developed with three detection formats; a real-time intercalating dye-based assay, a real-time probe-based assay to enable multiplexing and an end-point colourimetric assay to simplify interpretation for the field. All assay formats were sensitive and specific, detecting a range of Ebola virus strains isolated in 1976-2014; with Probit analysis predicting limits of detection of 243, 290 and 75 copies/reaction respectively and no cross-detection of related strains or other viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF's). The assays are rapid, (as fast as 5-7.25 mins for real-time formats) and robust, detecting Ebola virus RNA in presence of minimally diluted bodily fluids. Moreover, when tested on patient samples from the 2013/16 outbreak, there were no false positives and 93-96% of all new case positives were detected, with only a failure to detect very low copy number samples. Conclusion/Significance These are a set of robust and adaptable diagnostic solutions, which are fast, easy-to-perform-and-interpret and are suitable for use on a range of platforms including portable low-power devices. They can be readily transferred to field-laboratory settings, with no specific equipment needs and are therefore ideally placed for use in locations with limited resources.",NA,"Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine","2020"

It is enzootic in Pafuri, Kruger National Park in South Africa. The bacterium is amplified in a wild ungulate host, which then becomes a source of infection to the next host upon its death. The exact mechanisms involving the onset (index case) and termination of an outbreak are poorly understood, in part due to a paucity of information about the soil-based component of the bacterium's lifecycle. In this study, we present the unique isolation of a dsDNA bacteriophage from a wildebeest carcass site suspected of having succumbed to anthrax. The aggressively lytic bacteriophage hampered the initial isolation ofB. anthracisfrom samples collected at the carcass site. Classic bacteriologic methods were used to test the isolated phage onB. anthracisunder different conditions to simulate deteriorating carcass conditions. Whole genome sequencing was employed to determine the relationship between the bacterium isolated on site and the bacteriophage-dubbedBacillusphage Crookii. The 154,012 bp phage belongs toMyoviridaeand groups closely with another African anthrax carcass-associatedBacillusphage WPh.Bacillusphage Crookii was lytic againstB. cereus sensu latogroup members but demonstrated a greater affinity for encapsulatedB. anthracisat lower concentrations (<1 x 10(8)pfu) of bacteriophage.

This distinguishes them from most other viruses and demands additional effort for the successful recovery of their genomes from environmental sequence data. Here, we tested the performance of genome-resolved metagenomics on a recently isolated giant virus, Fadolivirus, by spiking it into an environmental sample from which two other giant viruses were isolated. At high spike-in levels, metagenome assembly and binning led to the successful genomic recovery of Fadolivirus from the sample. A complementary survey of the major capsid protein indicated the presence of other giant viruses in the sample matrix but did not detect the two isolated from this sample. Our results indicate that genome-resolved metagenomics is a valid approach for the recovery of near-complete giant virus genomes given that sufficient clonal particles are present. However, our data also underline that a vast majority of giant viruses remain currently undetected, even in an era of terabase-scale metagenomics. IMPORTANCE The discovery of large and giant nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) with genomes in the megabase range and equipped with a wide variety of features typically associated with cellular organisms was one of the most unexpected, intriguing, and spectacular breakthroughs in virology. Recent studies suggest that these viruses are highly abundant in the oceans, freshwater, and soil, impact the biology and ecology of their eukaryotic hosts, and ultimately affect global nutrient cycles. Genome-resolved metagenomics is becoming an increasingly popular tool to assess the diversity and coding potential of giant viruses, but this approach is currently lacking validation.","giant viruses; metagenomics; NCLDV","Microbiology","2020"

However, our knowledge about virus-host interactions and viral ecology in the deep sea remains very limited. In this study, a novel bacteriophage (designated as phage BVE2) infecting Bacillus cereus group bacteria, was isolated from deep-sea sediments. Phage BVE2 caused host lysis within 1.5 h after infection. However, the presence of two integrase-encoding genes in the BVE2 genome suggested that BVE2 may also follow a temperate strategy. The genome of phage BVE2 is approximately 20 kb in length and is predicted to encode 28 proteins. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis suggested that BVE2 is a highly mosaic phage that has inherited genetic features from Wbeta-like viruses, B. cereus prophages, and its host, suggesting that frequent horizontal gene transfer events occurred during its evolution.

Knowledge of their diversity and transmission in the wild is necessary for the management and conservation of host species like Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Although pathogen exchange can occur throughout the salmon life cycle, evidence is lacking to support transmission during population mixing at sea or between farmed and wild salmon due to aquaculture exposure. We tested these hypotheses using a molecular approach that identified infectious agents and transmission potential among sub-adult Atlantic salmon at marine feeding areas and adults in three eastern Canadian rivers with varying aquaculture influence. We used high-throughput qPCR to quantify infection profiles and next generation sequencing to measure genomic variation among viral isolates. We identified 14 agents, including five not yet described as occurring in Eastern Canada. Phylogenetic analysis of piscine orthoreovirus showed homology between isolates from European and North American origin fish at sea, supporting the hypothesis of intercontinental transmission. We found no evidence to support aquaculture influence on wild adult infections, which varied relative to environmental conditions, life stage, and host origin.

Investigating the bacteriophage community from soil will shed light not only on the yet largely unknown phage diversity, but may also result in novel insights towards their functioning in the global biogeochemical nutrient cycle and their significance in earthbound ecosystems. Unfortunately, information about soil viromes is rather scarce compared to aquatic environments, due to the heterogeneous soil matrix, which rises major technical difficulties in the extraction process. Resolving these technical challenges and establishing a standardized extraction protocol is, therefore, a fundamental prerequisite for replicable results and comparative virome studies. Results We here report the optimization of protocols for the extraction of phage DNA from agricultural soil preceding metagenomic analysis such that the protocol can equally be harnessed for phage isolation. As an optimization strategy, soil samples were spiked with Listeria phage A511 (Myovirus), Staphylococcus phage 2638A Delta LCR (Siphovirus) and Escherichia phage T7 (Podovirus) (each 10(6) PFU/g soil). The efficacy of phage (i) elution, (ii) filtration, (iii) concentration and (iv) DNA extraction methods was tested. Successful extraction routes were selected based on spiked phage recovery and low bacterial 16S rRNA gene contaminants. Natural agricultural soil viromes were then extracted with the optimized methods and shotgun sequenced. Our approach yielded sufficient amounts of inhibitor-free viral DNA for shotgun sequencing devoid of amplification prior library preparation, and low 16S rRNA gene contamination levels (<= 0.2 parts per thousand). Compared to previously published protocols, the number of bacterial read contamination was decreased by 65%. In addition, 379 novel putative complete soil phage genomes (<= 235 kb) were obtained from over 13,000 manually identified viral contigs, promising the discovery of a large, previously inaccessible viral diversity. Conclusion We have shown a considerably enhanced extraction of the soil phage community by protocol optimization that has proven robust in both culture-dependent as well as through viromic analyses. Our huge data set of manually curated soil viral contigs substantially increases the amount of currently available soil virome data, and provides insights into the yet largely undescribed soil viral sequence space.","Bacteriophage extraction; Phage virome; Soil samples; Bacterial and contamination; Spike-in","Microbiology","2020"

It is associated with permanent freshwater habitats where it can be very abundant and the cause of significant nuisance biting. Additionally, Cq. linealis is thought to be a significant vector of some arboviruses, such as Ross River virus, because numerous isolates have been recovered from the species. Although recognition of the species in 1889 was based on adult females, the larval stage has never been described. This lack of description has been primarily because the larvae are cryptic; all larval stages have modified respiratory siphons that pierce and remain attached to subsurface tissues of aquatic plants, from which they gain oxygen. Similarly, pupae have modified respiratory trumpets to attach to plants below the water surface. In this study, adult host-seeking females were field collected and blood fed for oviposition, and the resulting larvae were reared to adults to establish a sustainable colony, from which fourth-instar larvae were selected to provide the first formal description of this life stage of Cq. linealis. This description allows differentiation of Cq. linealis from larvae of its local congener Coquillettidia xanthogaster (Edwards) as well as local Mansonia species but not the larvae of the other Coquillettidia species in Australia that are still undescribed.","Coquillettidia linealis; Coquillettidia xanthogaster; larval and identification; Mansonia uniformis; mosquito; taxonomy","Entomology","2020"

Here, a six-member model bacterial community was used to identify the interactions and individual contributions of each species to community biofilm formation. These bacteria were isolated from the International Space Station potable water system and include Cupriavidus metallidurans, Chryseobacterium gleum, Raistonia insidiosa, Ralstonia pickettii, Methylorubrum (Methylobacterium) populi and Sphingomonas paucimobilis, but all six species are common members of terrestrial potable water systems. Using reconstituted assemblages, from pairs to all 6 members, community biofilm formation was observed to be robust to the absence of any single species and only removal of the C. gleum/S. paucimobilis pair, out of all 15 possible 2-species subtractions, led to loss of community biofilm formation. In conjunction with these findings, dual-species biofilm formation assays supported the view that the contribution of C. gleum to community biofilm formation was dependent on synergistic biofilm formation with either R. insidiosa or C. metallidurans. These data support a model of multiple, partially redundant species interactions to generate robustness in biofilm formation. A bacteriophage and multiple predatory bacteria were used to test the resilience of the community to the removal of individual members in situ, but the combination of precise and substantial depletion of a single target species was not achievable.

Here, we report two new isolates of Pandoravirus spp. and one Mimivirus sp., named Pandoravirus hades, Pandoravirus persephone, and Mimivirus sp. isolate styx, co-isolated from riverbank soil in Japan. We obtained nearly complete sequences of the family B DNA polymerase gene (polB) of P. hades and P. persephone; the former carried two known intein regions, while the latter had only one. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two new pandoravirus isolates are closely related to Pandoravirus dulcis. Furthermore, random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed that P. hades and P. persephone might harbor different genome structures. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the partial polB sequence, Mimivirus sp. isolate styx belongs to mimivirus lineage A. DNA staining suggested that the Pandoravirus spp. asynchronously replicates in amoeba cells while Mimivirus sp. replicates synchronously. We also observed that P. persephone- or Mimivirus sp. isolate styx-infected amoeba cytoplasm is extruded by the cells. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the isolation of pandoraviruses in Asia.

Many characterized bacteriophages infect a small subset of Enterobacteriaceae hosts. Despite its similarity to Escherichia coli, the pathogenic Shigella fleacneri has relatively few known phages, which exhibit significant differences from many E. coli phages. This suggests that isolating additional Shigella phages is necessary to further explore these differences. To address questions of novelty and prevalence, high school students isolated bacteriophages on non-pathogenic strains of enteric bacteria. Results indicate that Shigella phages are abundant in the environment and continue to differ significantly from E. coli phages. Our findings suggest that Shigella-infecting members of the Ounavirinae subfamily continue to be over-represented and show surprisingly low diversity within and between sampling sites. Additionally, a podophage with distinct genomic and structural properties suggests that continued isolation on non-model species of bacteria is necessary to truly understand bacteriophage diversity.","Bacteriophage hunting; Shigella bacteriophage; Autographivirinae; and Ounavirinae; Mooglevirus; High school research; Bacteriophage diversity; and Virus ecology; Genomics; Phylogenetics","Virology","2019"

Eight complete fully annotated 13-22 Mb genomes from three genera, Ostreococcus, Bathycoccus and Micromonas, are available from previously isolated clonal cultured strains and provide an ideal resource to explore the scope and challenges of analysing single cell amplified genomes (SAGs) isolated from a natural environment. We assembled data from 12 SAGs sampled during the Tara Oceans expedition to gain biological insights about their in situ ecology, which might be lost by isolation and strain culture. Although the assembled nuclear genomes were incomplete, they were large enough to infer the mating types of four Ostreococcus SAGs. The systematic occurrence of sequences from the mitochondria and chloroplast, representing less than 3% of the total cell's DNA, intimates that SAGs provide suitable substrates for detection of non-target sequences, such as those of virions. Analysis of the non-Mamiellophyceae assemblies, following filtering out cross-contaminations during the sequencing process, revealed two novel 1.6 and 1.8 kb circular DNA viruses, and the presence of specific Bacterial and Oomycete sequences suggests that these organisms might co-occur with the Mamiellales.

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of 45 phages of Salmonella enterica from disparate geographic locations within British Columbia, Canada. Host-range profiling revealed host-specific patterns of susceptibility and resistance, with several phages identified that have a broad-host range (i.e., able to lyse >40% of bacterial hosts tested). One phage in particular, SE13, is able to lyse 51 out of the 61 Salmonella strains tested. Comparative genomic analyses also revealed an abundance of sequence diversity in the sequenced phages. Alignment of the genomes grouped the phages into 12 clusters with three singletons. Phages within certain clusters exhibited extraordinarily high genome homology (>98% nucleotide identity), yet between clusters, genomes exhibited a span of diversity (<50% nucleotide identity). Alignment of the major capsid protein also supported the clustering pattern observed with alignment of the whole genomes. We further observed associations between genomic relatedness and the site of isolation, as well as genetic elements related to DNA metabolism and host virulence. Our data support the knowledge framework for phage diversity and phage-host interactions that are required for developing phage-based applications for various sectors, including biocontrol, detection and typing.","Bacteriophage; Salmonella; biocontrol; comparative genomics; phage and diversity","Virology","2019"

Photosynthesis AMGs are commonly found in marine cyanobacteria-infecting Myoviridae and Podoviridae cyanophages, but their ecology remains understudied in freshwater environments. To advance knowledge of this issue, we analysed viral metagenomes collected in the summertime for four years from five lakes and two estuarine locations interconnected by the Chattahoochee River, Southeast USA. Sequences representing ten different AMGs were recovered and found to be prevalent in all sites. Most freshwater AMGs were 10-fold less abundant than estuarine and marine AMGs and were encoded by novel Myoviridae and Podoviridae cyanophage genera. Notably, several of the corresponding viral genomes showed endemism to a specific province along the river. This translated into psbA gene phylogenetic clustering patterns that matched a marine vs. freshwater origin indicating that psbA may serve as a robust classification and source-tracking biomarker. Genomes classified in a novel viral lineage represented by isolate S-EIVl contained psbA, which is unprecedented for this lineage. Collectively, our findings indicated that the acquisition of photosynthesis AMGs is a widespread strategy used by cyanophages in aquatic ecosystems, and further indicated the existence of viral provinces in which certain viral species and/or genotypes are locally abundant.",NA,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology","2019"

Based on studies in marine systems, viruses infecting soil microbes likely modulate host activities via mortality, horizontal gene transfer, and metabolic control. However, their roles remain largely unexplored due to technical challenges with separating, isolating, and extracting DNA from viruses in soils. Some of these challenges have been overcome by using whole genome amplification methods and while these have allowed insights into the identities of soil viruses and their genomes, their inherit biases have prevented meaningful ecological interpretations. Here we experimentally optimized steps for generating quantitatively-amplified viral metagenomes to better capture both ssDNA and dsDNA viruses across three distinct soil habitats along a permafrost thaw gradient. First, we assessed differing DNA extraction methods (PowerSoil, Wizard mini columns, and cetyl trimethylammonium bromide) for quantity and quality of viral DNA. This established PowerSoil as best for yield and quality of DNA from our samples, though similar to 1/3 of the viral populations captured by each extraction kit were unique, suggesting appreciable differential biases among DNA extraction kits. Second, we evaluated the impact of purifying viral particles after resuspension (by cesium chloride gradients; CsCl) and of viral lysis method (heat vs bead-beating) on the resultant viromes. DNA yields after CsCl particle-purification were largely non-detectable, while unpurified samples yielded 1-2-fold more DNA after lysis by heat than by bead-beating. Virome quality was assessed by the number and size of metagenome-assembled viral contigs, which showed no increase after CsCI-purification, but did from heat lysis relative to bead-beating. We also evaluated sample preparation protocols for ssDNA virus recovery. In both CsCl-purified and non-purified samples, ssDNA viruses were successfully recovered by using the Accel-NGS 1S Plus Library Kit. While ssDNA viruses were identified in all three soil types, none were identified in the samples that used bead-beating, suggesting this lysis method may impact recovery. Further, 13 ssDNA vOTUs were identified compared to 582 dsDNA vOTUs, and the ssDNA vOTUs only accounted for similar to 4% of the assembled reads, implying dsDNA viruses were dominant in these samples. This optimized approach was combined with the previously published viral resuspension protocol into a sample-to-virome protocol for soils now available at protocols.io, where community feedback creates 'living' protocols. This collective approach will be particularly valuable given the high physicochemical variability of soils, which will may require considerable soil type-specific optimization. This optimized protocol provides a starting place for developing quantitatively-amplified viromic datasets and will help enable viral ecogenomic studies on organic-rich soils.","Soil viruses; Viromes; DNA extraction; Organics; Microbiology; ssDNA and viruses; dsDNA viruses; Viromics","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2019"

While viruses play key roles in regulating the abundance, production and diversity of their hosts in aquatic ecosystems, the role(s) of viruses in the ecology of C. raciborskii is almost unexplored. Progress in this field has been hindered by the absence of a characterized virus-host system in C. raciborskii. To bridge this gap, we sequenced the genome of CrV-01T, a previously isolated cyanosiphovirus, and its host, C. raciborskii strain Cr2010. Analyses suggest that CrV-01T represents a distinct clade of siphoviruses infecting, and perhaps lysogenizing, filamentous cyanobacteria. Its genome contains unique features that include an intact CRISPR array and a 12 kb inverted duplication. Evidence suggests CrV-01T recently gained the ability to infect Cr2010 and recently lost the ability to form lysogens. The cyanobacterial host contains a CRISPR-Cas system with CRISPR spacers matching protospacers within the inverted duplication of the CrV-01T genome. Examination of metagenomes demonstrates that viruses with high genetic identity to CrV-01T, but lacking the inverted duplication, are present in C. raciborskii blooms in Australia. The unique genomic features of the CrV/Cr2010 system offers opportunities to investigate in more detail virus-host interactions in an ecologically important bloom-forming cyanobacterium.",NA,"Microbiology","2019"

We have isolated two phages infecting Lentibacter sp. SH36, affiliated with the marine Roseobacter group, and retrieved similar phage genomes from publicly available metagenomics databases. Phylogenetic analysis placed the new phages within the Cobavirus group, in the here newly proposed genus Siovirus and subfamily Riovirinae of the Podoviridae. Gene composition and presence of direct terminal repeats in cultivated cobaviruses point toward a genome replication and packaging strategy similar to the T7 phage. Investigation of the genomes suggests that viral lysis of the cell proceeds via the canonical holin-endolysin pathway. Cobaviral hosts include members of the genera Lentibacter, Sulfitobacter and Celeribacter of the Roseobacter group within the family Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria). Screening more than 5,000 marine metagenomes, we found cobaviruses worldwide from temperate to tropical waters, in the euphotic zone, mainly in bays and estuaries, but also in the open ocean. The presence of cobaviruses in protist metagenomes as well as the phylogenetic neighborhood of cobaviruses in glutaredoxin and ribonucleotide reductase trees suggest that cobaviruses could infect bacteria associated with phototrophic or grazing protists.

We analyzed 360 samples of carps, phytoplankton and water collected in 2017 during dry and rainy seasons in the Tanzanian basin of Lake Victoria. Samples were tested using PCR (ompW and ctxA) with DNA extracted from bacterial isolates and samples enriched in alkaline peptone water. Isolates were screened with polyvalent antiserum O1 followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools were employed to investigate the genomic characteristics of the isolates. More V. cholerae positive samples were recovered by PCR when DNA was obtained from enriched samples than from isolates (69.0% vs. 21.3%, p < 0.05), irrespectively of season. We identified ten V. cholerae O1 among 22 ctxA-positive isolates. Further studies are needed to serotype the remaining ctxA-positive non-O1 strains. Sequenced strains belonged to El Tor atypical biotype of V. cholerae O1 of MLST ST69 harboring the seventh pandemic gene. Major virulence genes, ctxA, ctxB, zot, ace, tcpA, hlyA, rtxA, ompU, toxR, T6SS, alsD, makA and pathogenicity islands VPI-1, VPI-2, VSP-1, and VSP-2 were found in all strains. The strains contained Vibrio polysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes, the mshA gene and two-component response regulator proteins involved in stress response and autoinducers for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. They carried the SXT integrative conjugative element with phenotypic and genotypic resistance to aminoglycoside, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, phenicol, and quinolones. Strains contained a multidrug efflux pump component and were resistant to toxic compounds with copper homeostasis and cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance proteins. The environmental strains belonged to the third wave of the seventh pandemic and most are genetically closely related to recent outbreak strains from Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda with as low as three SNPs difference. Some strains have persisted longer in the environment and were more related to older outbreak strains in the region.

Short-read viral metagenomic studies have provided clues to viral function and first estimates of global viral gene abundance and distribution, but their assemblies are confounded by populations with high levels of strain evenness and nucleotide diversity (microdiversity), limiting assembly of some of the most abundant viruses on Earth. Such features also challenge assembly across genomic islands containing niche-defining genes that drive ecological speciation. These populations and features may be successfully captured by single-virus genomics and fosmid-based approaches, at least in abundant taxa, but at considerable cost and technical expertise. Here we established a low-cost, low-input, high throughput alternative sequencing and informatics workflow to improve viral metagenomic assemblies using short-read and long-read technology. The 'VirION' (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing) approach was first validated using mock communities where it was found to be as relatively quantitative as short-read methods and provided significant improvements in recovery of viral genomes. We then then applied VirION to the first metagenome from a natural viral community from the Western English Channel. In comparison to a short-read only approach, VirION: (i) increased number and completeness of assembled viral genomes; (ii) captured abundant, highly microdiverse virus populations, and (iii) captured more and longer genomic islands. Together, these findings suggest that VirION provides a high throughput and cost-effective alternative to fosmid and single-virus genomic approaches to more comprehensively explore viral communities in nature.","Viral Metagenomics; Virus; Virome; Metagenome; Assembly; Viral ecology; and Long-read sequencing; Marine Microbiology","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2019"

Here, we implemented large-scale gene-species phylogenetic tree reconstructions and reconciliations to identify putative HGT-derived genes in the reference genomes of microbiota isolated from six major human body sites by the NIH Human Microbiome Project. Comparisons with a control group representing microbial genomes from diverse natural environments indicated that HGT activity increased significantly in the genomes of human microbiota, which is confirmatory of previous findings. Roughly, more than half of total genes in the genomes of human-associated microbiota were transferred (donated or received) by HGT. Up to 60% of the detected HGTs occurred either prior to the colonization of the human body or involved bacteria residing in different body sites. The latter could suggest 'genetic crosstalk' and movement of bacterial genes within the human body via hitherto poorly understood mechanisms. We also observed that HGT activity increased significantly among closely-related microorganisms and especially when they were united by physical proximity, suggesting that the 'phylogenetic effect' can significantly boost HGT activity. Finally, we identified several core and widespread genes least influenced by HGT that could become useful markers for building robust 'trees of life' and address several outstanding technical challenges to improve the phylogeny-based genome-wide HGT detection method for future applications.",NA,"Science & Technology - Other Topics","2019"

Despite an increased interest in giant viruses since the discovery and characterization of Mimivirus and other viral giants, little is known about their physiology and ecology. In this study, we characterized the genome and functional potential of a giant virus that infects the freshwater haptophyte Chrysochromulina parva, originally isolated from Lake Ontario. This virus, CpV-BQ2, is a member of the nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) group and possesses a 437 kb genome encoding 503 ORFs with a GC content of 25%. Phylogenetic analyses of core NCLDV genes place CpV-BQ2 amongst the emerging group of algae-infecting Mimiviruses informally referred to as the ""extended Mimiviridae,"" making it the first virus of this group to be isolated from a freshwater ecosystem. During genome analyses, we also captured and described the genomes of three distinct virophages that co-occurred with CpV-BQ2 and likely exploit CpV for their own replication. These virophages belong to the polinton-like viruses (PLV) group and encompass 19-23 predicted genes, including all of the core PLV genes as well as several genes implicated in genome modifications. We used the CpV-BQ2 and virophage reference sequences to recruit reads from available environmental metatranscriptomic data to estimate their activity in fresh waters. We observed moderate recruitment of both virus and virophage transcripts in samples obtained during Microcystis aeruginosa blooms in Lake Erie and Lake Tai, China in 2013, with a spike in activity in one sample. Virophage transcript abundance for two of the three isolates strongly correlated with that of the CpV-BQ2.

Yet, there are few well-described freshwater cyanophages relative to their marine counterparts, and in general, few cyanosiphoviruses (family Siphoviridae) have been characterized, limiting our understanding of the biology and the ecology of this prominent group of viruses. Here, we characterize S-LBS1, a freshwater siphovirus lytic to a phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus isolate (Strain TCC793). S-LBS1 has a narrow host range, a burst size of similar to 400 and a relatively long infecting step before cell lysis occurs. It has a dsDNA 34,641 bp genome with putative genes for structure, DNA packing, lysis, replication, host interactions, DNA repair and metabolism. S-LBS1 is similar in genome size, genome architecture, and gene content, to previously described marine siphoviruses also infecting PE-rich Synechococcus, e.g., S-CBS1 and S-CBS3. However, unlike other Synechococcus phages, S-LBS1 encodes an integrase, suggesting its ability to establish lysogenic relationships with its host. Sequence recruitment from viral metagenomic data showed that S-LBS1-like viruses are diversely present in a wide range of aquatic environments, emphasizing their potential importance in controlling and structuring Synechococcus populations. A comparative analysis with 16 available sequenced cyanosiphoviruses reveals the absence of core genes within the genomes, suggesting high degree of genetic variability in siphoviruses infecting cyanobacteria. It is likely that cyanosiphoviruses have evolved as distinct evolutionary lineages and that adaptive co-evolution occurred between these viruses and their hosts (i.e., Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, Nodularia, and Acaryochloris), constituting an important driving force for such phage diversification.","freshwater; lakes; Synechococcus; cyanosiphovirus; genome sequencing","Microbiology","2018"

The emerging urban structures should have a key influence on the spread and distribution of wildlife diseases such as canine distemper, by shaping density, distribution and movements of wildlife. However, little is known about the role of urban structures as proxies for disease prevalence. To guide management, especially in densely populated cities, assessing the role of landscape structures in hampering or promoting disease prevalence is thus of paramount importance. Between 2008 and 2013, two epidemic waves of canine distemper hit the urban red fox (Vulpes vulpes) population of Berlin, Germany. The directly transmitted canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a virulent disease infecting a range of mammals with high host mortality, particularly in juveniles. We extracted information about CDV serological state (seropositive or seronegative), sex and age for 778 urban fox carcasses collected by the state laboratory Berlin Brandenburg. To assess the impact of urban landscape structure heterogeneity (e.g., richness) and shares of green and gray infrastructures at different spatial resolutions (areal of 28 ha, 78 ha, 314 ha) on seroprevalence we used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models with binomial distributions. Our results indicated that predictors derived at a 28 ha resolution were most informative for describing landscape structure effects (AUC = 0.92). The probability to be seropositive decreased by 66% (0.6 to 0.2) with an increasing share of gray infrastructure (40 to 80%), suggesting that urbanization might hamper CDV spread in urban areas, owing to a decrease in host density (e.g., less foxes or raccoons) or an absence of wildlife movement corridors in strongly urbanized areas. However, less strongly transformed patches such as close-to-nature areas in direct proximity to water bodies were identified as high risk areas for CDV transmission. Therefore, surveillance and disease control actions targeting urban wildlife or human-wildlife interactions should focus on such areas. The possible underlying mechanisms explaining the prevalence distribution may be increased isolation, the absence of alternative hosts or an abiotic environment, all impairing the ability of CDV to persist without a host.","Berlin; canine distemper; CDV; disease; landscape structures; red fox and Vulpes vulpes; richness; urban wildlife","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","2018"

This study investigates the morphological diversity (TEM), taxonomic composition (metagenomics), and active infectivity (metatranscriptomics) of viral communities over a thermal gradient in hot spring phototrophic mats from Northern Patagonia (Chile). The mats were dominated (up to 53%) by cosmopolitan thermophilic filamentous true-branching cyanobacteria from the genus Mastigocladus, the associated viral community was predominantly composed of Caudovirales (70%), with most of the active infections driven by cyanophages (up to 90% of Caudovirales transcripts). Metagenomic assembly lead to the first full genome description of a T7-like Thermophilic Cyanophage recovered from a hot spring (Porcelana Hot Spring, Chile), with a temperature of 58 degrees C (TC-CHP58).

TC-CHP58 was associated to the Mastigocladus spp. by CRISPR spacers. Marked differences in metagenomic CRISPR loci number and spacers diversity, as well as SNVs, in the TC-CHP58 proto-spacers at different temperatures, reinforce the theory of coevolution between natural virus populations and cyanobacterial hosts.

Genomic variation in haloarchaea has been linked to viral infection pressure and, in the case of Antarctic communities, can be caused by intergenera gene exchange. To expand understanding of genome variation and biogeography of Antarctic haloarchaea, here we assessed genomic variation between two strains of Halorubrum lacusprofundi that were isolated from Antarctic hypersaline lakes from different regions (Vestfold Hills and Rauer Islands). To assess variation in haloarchaeal populations, including the presence of genomic islands, metagenomes from six hypersaline Antarctic lakes were characterised. Results: The sequence of the largest replicon of each Hrr. lacusprofundi strain (primary replicon) was highly conserved, while each of the strains' two smaller replicons (secondary replicons) were highly variable. Intergenera gene exchange was identified, including the sharing of a type I-B CRISPR system. Evaluation of infectivity of an Antarctic halovirus provided experimental evidence for the differential susceptibility of the strains, bolstering inferences that strain variation is important for modulating interactions with viruses. A relationship was found between genomic structuring and the location of variation within replicons and genomic islands, demonstrating that the way in which haloarchaea accommodate genomic variability relates to replicon structuring. Metagenome read and contig mapping and clustering and scaling analyses demonstrated biogeographical patterning of variation consistent with environment and distance effects. The metagenome data also demonstrated that specific haloarchaeal species dominated the hypersaline systems indicating they are endemic to Antarctica. Conclusion: The study describes how genomic variation manifests in Antarctic-lake haloarchaeal communities and provides the basis for future assessments of Antarctic regional and global biogeography of haloarchaea.","Haloarchaea; Halobacteria; Antarctica; Genome variation; Metagenomics; and Pan-genome; Genomic islands; Replicons; Virus infection; Biogeography","Microbiology","2018"

We performed the transcriptome analysis for A. longirostris and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between samples from the Iheya North hydrothermal vent (HV) and a methane seep in the South China Sea (MS). From the 57,801 annotated unigenes, multi-copies of enzyme family members for eliminating toxic xenobiotics were isolated and seven putatively duplicated gene clusters of cytochrome P450s were discovered, which may contribute to adaptation to the harsh conditions. Eight single amino acid substitutions of a Rhodopsin gene with low expression in two deep-sea alvinocaridid species were positively selected when compared with shallow water shrimps, which may be the result of adaptation to the dim-light environment in deep sea. 408 DEGs were identified with 53 and 355 up-regulated in HV and MS, respectively. Various genes associated with sulfur metabolism, detoxification and mitochondria were included, revealing different mechanisms of adaptation to the two types of extreme environments.

We participated in a winter expedition to the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, to isolate viruses and to measure virus-like particle abundance (flow cytometry) in sea ice. We isolated 59 bacterial strains and the first four Antarctic sea-ice viruses known (PANV1, PANV2, OANV1 and OANV2), which grow in bacterial hosts belonging to the typical sea-ice genera Paraglaciecola and Octadecabacter. The viruses were specific for bacteria at the strain level, although OANV1 was able to infect strains from two different classes. Both PANV1 and PANV2 infected 11/15 isolated Paraglaciecola strains that had almost identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, but the plating efficiencies differed among the strains, whereas OANV1 infected 3/7 Octadecabacter and 1/15 Paraglaciecola strains and OANV2 1/7 Octadecabacter strains. All the phages were cold-active and able to infect their original host at 0 degrees C and 4 degrees C, but not at higher temperatures.

Vibrio have also been isolated from pelagic waters, yet very little is known about the ecology of these oligotrophic species. In this study we examined the relative change in bacterial abundance and more specifically the dynamics of Vibrio in the tropical North Atlantic in response to the arrival of pulses of Saharan dust aerosols, a major source of biologically important nutrients for downwind marine surface waters. Aerosol and surface water samples were collected over 1 month coinciding with at least two distinct dust events. Total bacterial counts increased by 1.6-fold correlating with the arrival of Saharan dust (r = 0.76; p = 0.001). Virus-like particles (VLP) also followed this trend and were correlated with bacterial counts (r = 0.67; p = 0.01). Vibrio specific qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene ranged from below detection limits to a high of 9,145 gene copies ml(-1) with the arrival of dust. This increase equated to 6.5 x 10(2)-1.5 x 10(3) individual genome equivalents ml(-1) based on the known range of 16S rRNA copies among this genus. Vibrio exhibited bloom-bust cycles potentially attributed to selective viral lysis or bloom depletion of organic carbon. This work is one of the few studies to examine the open ocean ecology of Vibrio, a conditionally rare taxon, whose bloom-bust lifestyle likely is a contributing factor in the flow of nutrients and energy in pelagic ecosystems.","conditionally rare taxa; oligotrophic conditions; aerosols; desert dust; and Vibrio; marine ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology","2018"

A dynamic predator-prey mechanism called ""kill the winner"" suggests the elimination of most active bacterial populations through phages. Thus, interaction between phage and host has an effect on the composition of microbial communities in ecosystems. In this study, secondary phage metagenome data from aquatic habitats: wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), fresh, marine, and hot water spring habitat were analyzed using MG-RAST and STAMP tools to explore the diversity of the viruses. Differential relative abundance of phage families-Siphoviridae (34%) and Myoviridae (26%) in WWTP, Myoviridae (30%) and Podoviridae (23%) in fresh water, and Myoviridae (41%) and Podoviridae (8%) in marine-was found to be a discriminating factor among four habitats while Rudiviridae (9%), Globuloviridae (8%), and Lipothrixviridae (1%) were exclusively observed in hot water spring. Subsequently, at genera level, Bpp-1-like virus, Chlorovirus, and T4-like virus were found abundant in WWTP, fresh, and marine habitat, respectively. PCA analysis revealed completely disparate composition of phage in hot water spring from other three ecosystems. Similar analysis of relative abundance of functional features corroborated observations from taxa analysis. Functional features corresponding to phage packaging machinery, replication, integration and excision, and gene transfer discriminated among four habitats. The comparative metagenomics approach exhibited genetically distinct phage communities among four habitats. Results revealed that selective distribution of phage communities would help in understanding the role of phages in food chains, nutrient cycling, and microbial ecology. Study of specific phages would also help in controlling environmental pathogens including MDR bacterial populations using phage therapy approach by selective mining and isolation of phages against specific pathogens persisting in a given environment.",NA,"Microbiology","2018"

Loss of kelp forests has occurred over large areas in a number of temperate regions, including in Australia, where the dominant kelp Ecklonia radiata has been lost from substantial areas of the shoreline. Loss of E. radiata has been associated with environmental stressors, including increased temperature and anthropogenic contaminants, as well as biological factors, such as herbivory. Disease may also play a role, but there is little information on the role of disease in the loss of kelp from coastal ecosystems or on the potential role of pathogenic microorganisms, such as viruses. E. radiata across much of its distribution in Australia can develop a ""bleached"" phenotype, which may be a disease. To investigate whether the phenotype was associated with a potential viral agent, we shotgun sequenced viral particles that were isolated from kelp with normal (healthy) and bleached phenotypes. Each virome consisted of similar to 380,000 reads, of which similar to 25% were similar to known viruses. All samples were dominated by bacteriophages, but novel ssDNA virus sequences were detected that were almost exclusively in viromes from the bleached kelp phenotype. These ssDNA viruses are covered by 11 contigs that contained complete capsids and characteristic rep genes that were 30-60% similar to those of circular, Rep-encoding ssDNA viruses (CRESS-DNA viruses). CRESS-DNA viruses have not previously been described from macroalgae, and the rep genes were similar to CRESS-DNA viruses from marine water samples, snails, crabs, anemones, but also dragonflies. This raises the interesting possibility that the kelp could be a vector of the CRESS-DNA viruses to other organisms that are associated with the bleached state.","circovirus; microbial ecology; virome; kelp; marine disease; metagenome; and CRESS-DNA; viral ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology","2018"

The potential presence of unique microbial and viral biodiversity associated with this unique plant biodiversity led us to explore the fynbos soil using metaviromic techniques. In this study, metaviromes of a soil community from the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve has been characterised in detail for the first time. Metaviromic DNA was recovered from soil and sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing. The MetaVir, MG-RAST and VIROME bioinformatics pipelines were used to analyse taxonomic composition, phylogenetic and functional assessments of the sequences. Taxonomic composition revealed members of the order Caudovirales, in particular the family Siphoviridae, as prevalent in the soil samples and other compared viromes. Functional analysis and other metaviromes showed a relatively high frequency of phage-related and structural proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of PolB, PolB2, terL and T7gp17 genes indicated that many viral sequences are closely related to the order Caudovirales, while the remainder were distinct from known isolates. The use of single virome which only includes double stranded DNA viruses limits this study.

However, these programs are costly to maintain on a long-term basis. Therefore, we aimed to assess the validity of mosquito numbers and Ross River virus (RRV) isolates from surveillance trap sites as predictors of human RRV cases in south-west WA between 2003 and 2014. Using negative binomial regression modeling, mosquito surveillance was found to be a useful tool for predicting human RRV cases. In eight of the nine traps, when adjusted for season, there was an increased risk of RRV cases associated with elevated mosquito numbers detected 1 month before the onset of human cases for at least one quartile compared with the reference group. The most predictive urban trap sites were located near saltmarsh mosquito habitat, bushland that could sustain macropods and densely populated residential suburbs. This convergence of environments could allow enzootic transmission of RRV to spillover and infect the human population. Close proximity of urban trap sites to each other suggested these sites could be reduced. Ross River virus isolates were infrequent at some trap sites, so ceasing RRV isolation from mosquitoes at these sites or where isolates were not predictive of human cases could be considered. In future, trap sites could be reduced for routine surveillance, allowing other environments to be monitored to broaden the understanding of RRV ecology in the region. A more cost-effective and efficient surveillance program may result from these modifications.",NA,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Tropical Medicine","2018"

We studied the effect of onshore wind speeds on aerosol concentrations as well as total and culturable microbial aerosols (bacterial and viral) at an urban waterfront (New York, NY, USA). We used two distinct methods to characterize microbial aerosol responses to wind speed: A culture-based exposure-plate method measuring viable bacterial deposition near-shore (CFU accumulation rate); and a culture-independent aerosol sampler-based method measuring total bacterial and viral aerosols (cells m(-3) air). While ambient coarse (>2 mu m) and fine (0.3-2 mu m) aerosol particle number concentrations (regulated indicators of air quality) decreased with increasing onshore wind speeds, total and depositing culturable bacterial aerosols and total viral aerosols increased. Taxonomic identification of the 16S rDNA of bacterial aerosol isolates suggested both terrestrial and aquatic sources. Wind appears to increase microbial aerosol number concentrations in the near-shore environment by onshore transport at low wind speeds (<4 m s(-1)), and increased local production and transport of new microbial aerosols from adjacent water surfaces at higher wind speeds (>4 m s(-1)). This study demonstrates a wind-modulated microbial connection between water and air in the coastal urban environment, with implications for public health management and urban microbial ecology.","bacteria; virus; viral particle; air quality; water quality; coastal","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences","2017"

Since cholera is a water-borne disease, systematic monitoring of environmental waters for Vibrio cholerae presence is important for predicting and preventing cholera epidemics. We conducted monitoring, isolation, and genetic characterization of V. cholerae strains in Nam Dinh province of Northern Vietnam from Jul 2013 to Feb 2015. In this study, four V. cholerae O1 strains were detected and isolated from 110 analyzed water samples (3.6%); however, none of them carried the cholera toxin gene, ctxA, in their genomes. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four O1 isolates were separated into two independent clusters, and one of them diverged from a common ancestor with pandemic strains. The analysis of pathogenicity islands (CTX prophage, VPI-I, VPI-II, VSP-I, and VSP-II) indicated that one strain (VNND_2014Jun_6SS) harbored an unknown prophage-like sequence with high homology to vibriophage KSF-1 phi and VCY phi, identified from Bangladesh and the USA, respectively, while the other three strains carried tcpA gene with a distinct sequence demonstrating a separate clonal lineage. These results suggest that the aquatic environment can harbor highly divergent V. cholera strains and serve as a reservoir for multiple V. cholerae virulence-associated genes which may be exchanged via mobile genetic elements. Therefore, continuous monitoring and genetic characterization of V. cholerae strains in the environment should contribute to the early detection of the sources of infection and prevention of cholera outbreaks as well as to understanding the natural ecology and evolution of V. cholerae.

Here we describe a new archaeal virus, tentatively named Metallosphaera turreted icosahedral virus (MTIV), that was isolated from an acidic hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Two strains of the virus were identified and were found to replicate in an archaeal host species closely related to Metallosphaera yellowstonensis. Each strain encodes a 9.8-to 9.9-kb linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome with large inverted terminal repeats. Each genome encodes 21 open reading frames (ORFs). The ORFs display high homology between the strains, but they are quite distinct from other known viral genes. The 70-nm-diameter virion is built on a T = 28 icosahedral lattice. Both single particle cryoelectron microscopy and cryotomography reconstructions reveal an unusual structure that has 42 turret-like projections: 12 pentameric turrets positioned on the icosahedral 5-fold axes and 30 turrets with apparent hexameric symmetry positioned on the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Both the virion structural properties and the genome content support MTIV as the founding member of a new family of archaeal viruses. IMPORTANCE Many archaeal viruses are quite different from viruses infecting bacteria and eukaryotes. Initial characterization of MTIV reveals a virus distinct from other known bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeal viruses; this finding suggests that viruses infecting Archaea are still an understudied group. As the first known virus infecting a Metallosphaera sp., MTIV provides a new system for exploring archaeal virology by examining host-virus interactions and the unique features of MTIV structure-function relationships.

"121","Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide Destabilizes Influenza Viruses","Bandoro, C and Runstadler, JA","MSPHERE","Depending on the specific viral pathogen, commensal bacteria can promote or reduce the severity of viral infection and disease progression in their hosts. Influenza A virus (IAV) has a broad host range, comprises many subtypes, and utilizes different routes of transmission, including the fecal-oral route in wild birds. It has been previously demonstrated that commensal bacteria can interact with the host's immune system to protect against IAV pathogenesis. However, it is unclear whether bacteria and their products may be interacting directly with IAV to impact virion stability. Herein we show that gastrointestinal (GI) tract bacterial isolates in an in vitro system significantly reduce the stability of IAV. Moreover, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), found on the exterior surfaces of bacteria, was sufficient to significantly decrease the stability of both human and avian viral strains in a temperature-dependent manner, including at the relevant temperatures of their respective hosts and the external aquatic habitat. The subtype and host origin of the viruses were shown to affect the extent to which IAV was susceptible to LPS. Furthermore, using a receptor binding assay and transmission electron microscopy, we observed that LPS binds to and alters the morphology of influenza virions, suggesting that direct interaction with the viral surface contributes to the observed antiviral effect of LPS on influenza. IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus (IAV), transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route in wild birds, encounters high concentrations of bacteria and their products. Understanding the extent to which bacteria affect the infectivity of IAV will lead to a broader understanding of viral ecology in reservoir hosts and may lead to insights for the development of therapeutics in respiratory infection. Herein we show that bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interact with and destabilize influenza virions. Moreover, we show that LPS reduces the long-term persistence and freeze-thaw stability of IAV, which is important information for modeling the movement and emergence of novel strains from animal hosts. Our results, demonstrating that the subtype and host origin of a virus also influence its susceptibility to LPS, raise key questions about the fitness of viruses in reservoir hosts, their potential to transmit to humans, and the importance of bacterial-viral interactions in viral ecology.","bacteria; environmental microbiology; influenza; lipopolysaccharide; and microbiome; virology","Microbiology","2017"

The carcass or tissues derived from infected birds may present the risk of the virus spreading to humans, animals, and the surrounding environment. In this study, we investigated the survival of the virus in feather, muscle, and liver tissues collected from six chickens (Gallus gallus) experimentally infected with HPAI H5N1 virus. The tissues were stored at +4 degrees C or +20 degrees C, and viral isolation was performed at different times for 360 days. The maximum periods for viral survival were observed in samples stored at +4 degrees C in all tissue types and were 240 days in feather tissues, 160 days in muscle, and 20 days in liver. The viral infectivity at +20 degrees C was maintained for a maximum of 30 days in the feather tissues, 20 days in muscle, and 3 days in liver. The viral inactivation rates partly overlapped in the feather and muscle tissues at the two temperatures. The virus was inactivated rapidly in the liver. Our experimental results indicate that the tissue type and temperature can greatly influence the survival of HPAI H5N1 virus in the tissues of infected chickens. IMPORTANCE Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype can cause massive losses of poultry, and people need to handle a large number of chicken carcasses contaminated with the virus at outbreak sites. This study evaluated how long the virus can keep its infectivity in the three types of tissues derived from chickens infected with the virus. Our experimental results indicate that the virus can survive in tissues for a specific period of time depending on the tissue type and temperature.

Yet our understanding of their roles in ecosystems is limited by the paucity of model systems available for hypothesis generation and testing. Further, virology is limited by the lack of a broadly accepted conceptual framework to classify viral diversity into evolutionary and ecologically cohesive units. Here, we introduce genomes, structural proteomes, and quantitative host range data for eight Pseudoalteromonas phages isolated from Helgoland (North Sea, Germany) and use these data to advance a genome-based viral operational taxonomic unit (OTU) definition. These viruses represent five new genera and inform 498 unaffiliated or unannotated protein clusters (PCs) from global virus metagenomes. In a comparison of previously sequenced Pseudoalteromonas phage isolates (n = 7) and predicted prophages (n = 31), the eight phages are unique. They share a genus with only one other isolate, Pseudoalteromonas podophage RIO-1 (East Sea, South Korea) and two Pseudoalteromonas prophages. Mass-spectrometry of purified viral particles identified 12-20 structural proteins per phage. When combined with 3-D structural predictions, these data led to the functional characterization of five previously unidentified major capsid proteins. Protein functional predictions revealed mechanisms for hijacking host metabolism and resources. Further, they uncovered a hybrid sipho-myovirus that encodes genes for Mu-like infection rarely described in ocean systems. Finally, we used these data to evaluate a recently introduced definition for virus populations that requires members of the same population to have >95% average nucleotide identity across at least 80% of their genes. Using physiological traits and genomics, we proposed a conceptual model for a viral OTU definition that captures evolutionarily cohesive and ecologically distinct units. In this trait-based framework, sensitive hosts are considered viral niches, while host ranges and infection efficiencies are tracked as viral traits. Quantitative host range assays revealed conserved traits within virus OTUs that break down between OTUs, suggesting the defined units capture niche and fitness differentiation. Together these analyses provide a foundation for model system-based hypothesis testing that will improve our understanding of marine copiotrophs, as well as phage-host interactions on the ocean particles and aggregates where Pseudoalteromonas thrive.","phage; marine microbiology; particle-associated; comparative genomics; and Pseudoalteromonas","Microbiology","2017"

Bacterial reads in viromes are abundant but the extent to which this genetic material is playing a role in the ecology of aquatic microbiology remains unclear. To this aim, we developed of a useful approach for the characterization of viral and microbial communities of aquatic environments with a particular focus on the identification of microbial genes harbored in the viromes. Virus-like particles were isolated from water samples collected across the Lambro River, from the spring to the high urbanized Milan area. The derived viromes were analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing looking for the presence, relative abundance of bacterial genes with particular focus on those genes involved in antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes have been identified in all virome samples together with a high abundance of reads assigned to cellular processes and signaling. Virome data compared to those identified in the microbiome isolated from the same sample revealed differences in terms of functional categories and their relative abundance. To verify the role of aquatic viral population in bacterial gene transfer, water-based mesocosms were perturbed or not perturbed with a low dose of tetracycline.

Methods: Standard virus enrichment and double-layer agar methods were used to isolate and characterize the phage. Morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy, and a one-step growth curve assay was performed. The phage genome was sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform and annotated using standard bioinformatics tools. Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on the deduced amino acid sequences of terminase, endolysin, portal protein, and major capsid protein, and genome recruitment analysis was conducted using Jiulong River Estuary Virome, Pacific Ocean Virome and Global Ocean Survey databases. Results: A novel phage, vB_EliS-R6L, from coastal waters of Xiamen, China, was isolated and found to infect the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis DSM 8509. Morphological observation and genome analysis revealed that phage vB_EliS-R6L is a siphovirus with a 65.7-kb genome that encodes 108 putative gene products. The phage exhibits growth at a wide range of temperature and pH conditions. Genes encoding five methylase-related proteins were found in the genome, and recognition site predictions suggested its resistance to restriction-modification host systems. Genomic comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicate that phage vB_EliS-R6L is distinct from other known phages. Metagenomic recruitment analysis revealed that vB_EliS-R6L like phages are widespread in marine environments, with likely distribution in coastal waters.

"127","Genomic characterization of two novel pathogenic avipoxviruses isolated from pacific shearwaters (Ardenna spp.)","Sarker, S and Das, S and Lavers, JL and Hutton, I and Helbig, K and Imbery, J and Upton, C and Raidal, SR","BMC GENOMICS","Background: Over the past 20 years, many marine seabird populations have been gradually declining and the factors driving this ongoing deterioration are not always well understood. Avipoxvirus infections have been found in a wide range of bird species worldwide, however, very little is known about the disease ecology of avian poxviruses in seabirds. Here we present two novel avipoxviruses from pacific shearwaters (Ardenna spp), one from a Flesh-footed Shearwater (A. carneipes) (SWPV-1) and the other from a Wedge-tailed Shearwater (A. pacificus) (SWPV-2). Results: Epidermal pox lesions, liver, and blood samples were examined from A. carneipes and A. pacificus of breeding colonies in eastern Australia. After histopathological confirmation of the disease, PCR screening was conducted for avipoxvirus, circovirus, reticuloendotheliosis virus, and fungal agents. Two samples that were PCR positive for poxvirus were further assessed by next generation sequencing, which yielded complete Shearwaterpox virus (SWPV) genomes from A. pacificus and A. carneipes, both showing the highest degree of similarity with Canarypox virus (98% and 67%, respectively). The novel SWPV-1 complete genome from A. carneipes is missing 43 genes compared to CNPV and contains 4 predicted genes which are not found in any other poxvirus, whilst, SWPV-2 complete genome was deemed to be missing 18 genes compared to CNPV and a further 15 genes significantly fragmented as to probably cause them to be non-functional. Conclusion: These are the first avipoxvirus complete genome sequences that infect marine seabirds. In the comparison of SWPV-1 and -2 to existing avipoxvirus sequences, our results indicate that the SWPV complete genome from A. carneipes (SWPV-1) described here is not closely related to any other avipoxvirus genome isolated from avian or other natural host species, and that it likely should be considered a separate species.","Avipoxvirus; Poxvirus; Next generation sequencing; dermatitis; Ardenna; and Shearwater","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity","2017"

Most studies of phytoplankton host-virus interactions have focused on bloom-forming species like Emiliania huxleyi or Phaeocystis spp. The role of viruses infecting phytoplankton that do not form conspicuous blooms have received less attention. Here we explore the dynamics of phytoplankton and algal viruses over several sequential seasons, with a focus on the ubiquitous and diverse phytoplankton division Haptophyta, and their double-stranded DNA viruses, potentially with the capacity to infect the haptophytes. Viral and phytoplankton abundance and diversity showed recurrent seasonal changes, mainly explained by hydrographic conditions. By 454 tag-sequencing we revealed 93 unique haptophyte operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with seasonal changes in abundance. Sixty-one unique viral OTUs, representing Megaviridae and Phycodnaviridae, showed only distant relationship with currently isolated algal viruses. Haptophyte and virus community composition and diversity varied substantially throughout the year, but in an uncoordinated manner. A minority of the viral OTUs were highly abundant at specific time-points, indicating a boom-bust relationship with their host. Most of the viral OTUs were very persistent, which may represent viruses that coexist with their hosts, or able to exploit several host species.","Haptophyta; Phycodnaviridae; Megaviridae; viral-host interactions; and metagenomics; marine viral ecology","Virology","2017"

By using the power of CRISPR, spacers to link viruses to their prokaryotic hosts, we. explored virus-host interactions in geographically diverse salterns. Using taxonomic profiling, we identified hosts such as archaeal Haloquadratum, Halorubrum, and Haloarcula and bacterial Salinibacter, and we found that community composition related to not only salinity but also local environmental dynamics. Characterizing glycerol metabolism genes in these metagenomes suggested Halorubrum and Haloquadratum possess most dihydroxyacetone kinase genes while Salinibacter possesses most glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes. Using two different methods, we detected fewer CRISPR spacers in Haloquadratum-dominated compared with Halobacteriaceae-dominated saltern metagenomes. After CRISPR detection, spacers were aligned against haloviral genomes to map virus to host. While most alignments for each saltern metagenome linked viruses to Haloquadraturn walsbyi, there were also alignments indicating interactions with the low abundance taxa Haloarcula and Haloferax. Further examination of the dinucleotide and trinucleotide usage differences between paired viruses and their hosts confirmed viruses and hosts had similar nucleotide usage signatures. Detection of cas genes in the salterns supported the Possibility of CRISPR activity. Taken together, our studies suggest similar virus-host interactions exist in different solar salterns and that the glycerol metabolism gene dihydroxyacetone kinase s associated with Haloquadratum and Halorubrum.","CRISPR; Hypersaline ecosystems; Metagenomics; Microbial ecology; and Halophiles; Viral shunt; Bioinformatics; Extremophiles; Environmental and genomics; Viruses","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2017"

In addition to reducing biomass and influencing the genetic diversity of their host populations, they can also have a wider community-level impact due to the release of nutrients by phage-induced cell lysis. In this study, we isolated and characterized a new cyanophage, a siphophage designated as vB_NpeS-2AV2, capable of infecting the filamentous nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium Nodularia sp. AV2 with a lytic cycle between 12 and 18 hours. The role of the phage in the ecology of its host Nodularia and competitor Synechococcus was investigated in a set of microcosm experiments. Initially, phage-induced cell lysis decreased the number of Nodularia cells in the cultures. However, around 18%-27% of the population was resistant against the phage infection. Nitrogen was released from the Nodularia cells as a consequence of phage activity, resulting in a seven-fold increase in Synechococcus cell density. In conclusion, the presence of the cyanophage vB_NpeS-2AV2 altered the ecological dynamics in the cyanobacterial community and induced evolutionary changes in the Nodularia population, causing the evolution from a population dominated by susceptible cells to a population dominated by resistant ones.",NA,"Microbiology","2017"

Genomic analysis indicates that these mycobacteriophages can be grouped into 26 clusters based on genetic similarity. These clusters span a continuum of genetic diversity, with extensive genomic mosaicism among phages in different clusters. However, little is known regarding the primary hosts of these mycobacteriophages in their natural habitats, nor of their broader host ranges. As such, it is possible that the primary host of many newly isolated mycobacteriophages is not M. smegmatis, but instead a range of closely related bacterial species. However, determining mycobacteriophage host range presents difficulties associated with mycobacterial cultivability, pathogenicity and growth. Another way to gain insight into mycobacteriophage host range and ecology is through bioinformatic analysis of their genomic sequences. To this end, we examined the correlations between the codon usage biases of 199 different mycobacteriophages and those of several fully sequenced mycobacterial species in order to gain insight into the natural host range of these mycobacteriophages. We find that UPGMA clustering tends to match, but not consistently, clustering by shared nucleotide sequence identify. In addition, analysis of GC content, tRNA usage and correlations between mycobacteriophage and mycobacterial codon usage bias suggests that the preferred host of many clustered mycobacteriophages is not M. smegmatis but other, as yet unknown, members of the mycobacteria complex or closely allied bacterial species.","bacteriophages; codon bias; host range; mycobacteria; UPGMA clustering; and viral tRNAs","Genetics & Heredity; Microbiology","2016"

The H7N2 viruses were phylogenetically closely related to each other and to viruses isolated in Hong Kong in the 1970s. We determined the pathogenicity of the H7N2 viruses by infecting chickens and mice. Our results suggest that pikas might play an important role in the ecology of AIVs, acting as intermediate hosts in which viruses become more adapted to mammals.

The host range, genomic diversity, and abundance of these chimeric viruses, referred to as cruciviruses, remain largely unknown. In this article, we assembled and analyzed thirty-seven new crucivirus genomes from twelve peat viromes, representing twenty-four distinct genome organizations, and nearly tripling the number of available genomes for this group. All genomes possess the two characteristic genes encoding for the conserved capsid protein (CP) and a replication protein. Additional ORFs were conserved only in nearly identical genomes with no detectable similarity to known genes. Two cruciviruses possess putative introns in their replication-associated genes. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the replication proteins revealed intragene chimerism in at least eight chimeric genomes. This highlights the large extent of horizontal gene transfer and recombination events in the evolution of ssDNA viruses, as previously suggested. Read mapping analysis revealed that members of the 'Cruciviridae' group are particularly prevalent in peat viromes. Sequences matching the CP ranged from 0.6 up to 10.9 percent in the twelve peat viromes. In contrast, from sixty-nine available viromes derived from other environments, only twenty-four contained cruciviruses, which on average accounted for merely 0.2 percent of sequences. Overall, this study provides new genome information and insights into the diversity of chimeric viruses, a necessary first step in progressing toward an accurate quantification and host range identification of these new viruses.","virus ecology; viral metagenomics; virus diversity; ssDNA viruses","Virology","2016"

It represents a strong experimental model because the lake supports a low-complexity community of haloarchaea, with the three most abundant species totaling similar to 72%. Moreover, the dominant haloarchaea are cultivatable, and their genomes are sequenced. Here we use metaproteomics linked to metagenome data and the genome sequences of the isolates to characterize the main pathways, trophic strategies, and interactions associated with resource utilization. The dominance of the most abundant member, Halohasta litchfieldiae, appears to be predicated on competitive utilization of substrates (e.g., starch, glycerol, and dihydroxyacetone) produced by Dunaliella, the lake's primary producer, while also possessing diverse mechanisms for acquiring nitrogen and phosphorus. The second most abundant member, strain DL31, is proficient in degrading complex proteinaceous matter. Hht. litchfieldiae and DL31 are inferred to release labile substrates that are utilized by Halorubrum lacusprofundi, the third most abundant haloarchaeon in Deep Lake. The study also linked genome variation to specific protein variants or distinct genetic capacities, thereby identifying strain-level variation indicative of specialization. Overall, metaproteomics revealed that rather than functional differences occurring at different lake depths or through size partitioning, the main lake genera possess major trophic distinctions, and phylotypes (e.g., strains of Hht. litchfieldiae) exhibit a more subtle level of specialization. This study highlights the extent to which the lake supports a relatively uniform distribution of taxa that collectively possess the genetic capacity to effectively exploit available nutrients throughout the lake.",NA,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2016"

Viral lysis of diatoms, a key group of eukaryotic phytoplankton, has the potential to impact carbon export and marine food webs. However, the impact of viruses on diatom abundance and community composition is unknown. Diatom-virus dynamics were explored by sampling every month at two coastal and estuarine locations in Washington state, USA resulting in 41 new isolates of the pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia and 20 environmental virus samples. We conducted a total of 820 pair-wise crosses of the Pseudo-nitzschia isolates and viral communities. Viral communities infected Pseudo-nitzschia isolates in 8% of the crosses overall and 16% of crosses when the host and viral communities were isolated from the same sample. Isolates ranged in their permissivity to infection with some isolates not infected by any viral samples and others infected by up to 10 viral communities. Isolates that were infected by the most viral communities also had the highest maximum observed viral titers (as high as 16000 infectious units m1-1). Titers of the viral communities were host dependent, as titers for one viral sample on eight different hosts spanned four orders of magnitude. Sequencing of the Pseudonitzschla Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) of the revealed multiple subgroups of hosts with 100% ITS1 identities that were infected by different viral communities. Indeed, we repeatedly isolated groups of isolates with identical ITS1 sequences from the same water sample that displayed different viral infection phenotypes. The interactions between Pseudo-nitzschia and the viral communities highlight the diversity of diatoms and emphasize the complexity and variability of diatom-virus dynamics in the ocean.","diatom; phytoplankton; Pseudo-nitzschia; virus; microdiversity; titer; and harmful algal bloom","Microbiology","2016"
"137","Insect pathogens as biological control agents: Back to the future","Lacey, LA and Grzywacz, D and Shapiro-Ilan, DI and Frutos, R and Brownbridge, M and Goettel, MS","JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY","The development and use of entomopathogens as classical, conservation and augmentative biological control agents have included a number of successes and some setbacks in the past 15 years. In this forum paper we present current information on development, use and future directions of insect-specific viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes as components of integrated pest management strategies for control of arthropod pests of crops, forests, urban habitats, and insects of medical and veterinary importance. Insect pathogenic viruses are a fruitful source of microbial control agents (MCAs), particularly for the control of lepidopteran pests. Most research is focused on the baculoviruses, important pathogens of some globally important pests for which control has become difficult due to either pesticide resistance or pressure to reduce pesticide residues. Baculoviruses are accepted as safe, readily mass produced, highly pathogenic and easily formulated and applied control agents. New baculovirus products are appearing in many countries and gaining an increased market share. However, the absence of a practical in vitro mass production system, generally higher production costs, limited post application persistence, slow rate of kill and high host specificity currently contribute to restricted use in pest control. Overcoming these limitations are key research areas for which progress could open up use of insect viruses to much larger markets. A small number of entomopathogenic bacteria have been commercially developed for control of insect pests. These include several Bacillus thuringiensis sub-species, Lysinibacillus (Bacillus) sphaericus, Paenibacillus spp. and Serratia entomophila. B. thuringiensis sub-species kurstaki is the most widely used for control of pest insects of crops and forests, and B. thuringiensis sub-species israelensis and L. sphaericus are the primary pathogens used for control of medically important pests including dipteran vectors. These pathogens combine the advantages of chemical pesticides and MCAs: they are fast acting, easy to produce at a relatively low cost, easy to formulate, have a long shelf life and allow delivery using conventional application equipment and systemics (i.e. in transgenic plants). Unlike broad spectrum chemical pesticides, B. thuringiensis toxins are selective and negative environmental impact is very limited. Of the several commercially produced MCAs, B. thuringiensis (Bt) has more than 50% of market share. Extensive research, particularly on the molecular mode of action of Bt toxins, has been conducted over the past two decades. The Bt genes used in insect-resistant transgenic crops belong to the Cry and vegetative insecticidal protein families of toxins. Bt has been highly efficacious in pest management of corn and cotton, drastically reducing the amount of broad spectrum chemical insecticides used while being safe for consumers and non-target organisms. Despite successes, the adoption of Bt crops has not been without controversy. Although there is a lack of scientific evidence regarding their detrimental effects, this controversy has created the widespread perception in some quarters that Bt crops are dangerous for the environment. In addition to discovery of more efficacious isolates and toxins, an increase in the use of Bt products and transgenes will rely on innovations in formulation, better delivery systems and ultimately, wider public acceptance of transgenic plants expressing insect-specific Bt toxins. Fungi are ubiquitous natural entomopathogens that often cause epizootics in host insects and possess many desirable traits that favor their development as MCAs. Presently, commercialized microbial pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi largely occupy niche markets. A variety of molecular tools and technologies have recently allowed reclassification of numerous species based on phylogeny, as well as matching anamorphs (asexual forms) and teleomorphs (sexual forms) of several entomopathogenic taxa in the Phylum Ascomycota. Although these fungi have been traditionally regarded exclusively as pathogens of arthropods, recent studies have demonstrated that they occupy a great diversity of ecological niches. Entomopathogenic fungi are now known to be plant endophytes, plant disease antagonists, rhizosphere colonizers, and plant growth promoters. These newly understood attributes provide possibilities to use fungi in multiple roles. In addition to arthropod pest control, some fungal species could simultaneously suppress plant pathogens and plant parasitic nematodes as well as promote plant growth. A greater understanding of fungal ecology is needed to define their roles in nature and evaluate their limitations in biological control. More efficient mass production, formulation and delivery systems must be devised to supply an ever increasing market. More testing under field conditions is required to identify effects of biotic and abiotic factors on efficacy and persistence. Lastly, greater attention must be paid to their use within integrated pest management programs; in particular, strategies that incorporate fungi in combination with arthropod predators and parasitoids need to be defined to ensure compatibility and maximize efficacy. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are potent MCAs. Substantial progress in research and application of EPNs has been made in the past decade. The number of target pests shown to be susceptible to EPNs has continued to increase. Advancements in this regard primarily have been made in soil habitats where EPNs are shielded from environmental extremes, but progress has also been made in use of nematodes in above-ground habitats owing to the development of improved protective formulations. Progress has also resulted from advancements in nematode production technology using both in vivo and in vitro systems; novel application methods such as distribution of infected host cadavers; and nematode strain improvement via enhancement and stabilization of beneficial traits. Innovative research has also yielded insights into the fundamentals of EPN biology including major advances in genomics, nematode-bacterial symbiont interactions, ecological relationships, and foraging behavior. Additional research is needed to leverage these basic findings toward direct improvements in microbial control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike previously known microalgae-infecting viruses, TsV is a small (60 nm) DNA virus, with a 31 kb genome.

Microbial community metabolism in OMZs alters nutrient and energy flow through marine food webs, resulting in biological nitrogen loss and greenhouse gas production. Thus, viruses infecting OMZ microbes have the potential to modulate community metabolism with resulting feedback on ecosystem function. Here, we describe viral communities inhabiting oxic surface (10 m) and oxygen-starved basin (200 m) waters of Saanich Inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia using viral metagenomics and complete viral fosmid sequencing on samples collected between April 2007 and April 2010. Of 6459 open reading frames (ORFs) predicted across all 34 viral fosmids, 77.6% (n = 5010) had no homology to reference viral genomes. These fosmids recruited a higher proportion of viral metagenomic sequences from Saanich Inlet than from nearby northeastern subarctic Pacific Ocean (Line P) waters, indicating differences in the viral communities between coastal and open ocean locations. While functional annotations of fosmid ORFs were limited, recruitment to NCBI's non-redundant ""nr"" database and publicly available single-cell genomes identified putative viruses infecting marine thaumarchaeal and SUP05 proteobacteria to provide potential host linkages with relevance to coupled biogeochemical cycling processes in OMZ waters.

A total of 162 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained and identified by molecular methods. These isolates were classified into 35 different taxa in the genera Aspergilllus, Beltrania, Botryosphaeria, Colletotrichum, Diaporthe, Endomelanconiopsis, Fusarium, Guignardia, Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Pilidiella, Trichoderma, and Xylaria. The most frequent colonisers recovered of C. guianensis were Colletotrichum sp. 1, Diaporthe cf. mayteni, and Pestalotiopsis sp. 1. The fungal community had a moderate richness but high diversity and evenness indices. Colletotrichum sp. and Pilidiella wangiensis displayed selective antibacterial activity; Diaporthe cf. mayteni and Endomelanconiopsis endophytica showed high activity against amastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi; and Colletrotrichum sp. Guignardia mangiferae, Pestalotiopsis sp., and Diaporthe melonis were able to inhibit yellow fever virus proliferation. Our results suggest that the plants living in the tropical forest, such as the Amazonian hotspot region, can live in symbiosis with hidden and underestimated rich communities of endophytic fungi, which deserve protocols and/or specific laws to keep its future conservation. The capability of these endophytic fungi to produce bioactive compounds may be part of their chemical defense and adaptive response to survive and colonizing the plant host in wild environment. consequently, these fungal communities may provide a source of bioactive molecules, including those able to inhibit or control neglected tropical diseases.

Analysis of the genomes of five different Geobacter species recovered from contaminated subsurface sites indicated that each of the isolates had been infected with phage. Geobacter-associated phage sequences were also detected by metagenomic and proteomic analysis of samples from a uranium-contaminated aquifer undergoing in situ bioremediation, and phage particles were detected by microscopic analysis in groundwater collected from sediment enrichment cultures. Transcript abundance for genes from the Geobacter-associated phage structural proteins, tail tube Gp19 and baseplate J, increased in the groundwater in response to the growth of Geobacter species when acetate was added, and then declined as the number of Geobacter decreased. Western blot analysis of a Geobacter-associated tail tube protein Gp19 in the groundwater demonstrated that its abundance tracked with the abundance of Geobacter species.

The non-bloom forming picoplankter Micromonas pusilla, a significant component of the plankton community worldwide, is known to be susceptible to infection by both dsDNA and dsRNA viruses. Logically, comprehensive knowledge of the ecology of M. pusilla requires a better understanding of the diversity and infection mechanisms of their viruses. Here, we investigated 19 new M. pusilla-specific viruses (MpVs) isolated from different locations and years. We performed partial characterization of those MpVs including structural characteristics, genome size, phylogenetic analysis based on partial DNA polymerase gene sequences, host range, and stability at different temperatures and upon exposure to chloroform. Combined, these characteristics allowed classification of the MpVs into 2 groups. Exposure to chloroform led to loss of infectivity by all MpVs in one group, which suggests the presence of an outer lipid envelope. In addition, all except one of the members in that group formed a monophylogenetic clade that was distinct from all other MpV isolates. The distinctive characteristics of the 2 MpV groups suggest different infection strategies, which may have important implications for the ecology of both host and virus populations in the environment. Knowledge gained from our study adds value to the MpV isolates as a scientific resource as it will aid in developing and testing in the laboratory new hypotheses about the ecological and biogeochemical implications of M. pusilla viral infection in the environment.","Micromonas pusilla; Virus diversity; Phycodnaviridae; NCLDV; and Characterization; Lipids","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; and Microbiology","2015"

Amplicon deep-sequencing of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) revealed diverse and highly uneven communities of picorna-like viruses in the coastal waters of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Almost 300 000 pyrosequence reads revealed 145 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 95% sequence similarity at the amino-acid level. Each sample had between 24 and 71 OTUs and there was little overlap among samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that some clades of OTUs were only found at one site; whereas, other clades included OTUs from all sites. Since most of these OTUs are likely from viruses that infect eukaryotic phytoplankton, and viral isolates infecting phytoplankton are strain-specific; each OTU probably arose from the lysis of a specific phytoplankton taxon. Moreover, the patchiness in OTU distribution, and the high turnover of viruses in the mixed layer, implies continuous infection and lysis by RNA viruses of a diverse array of eukaryotic phytoplankton taxa. Hence, these viruses are likely important elements structuring the phytoplankton community, and play a significant role in nutrient cycling and energy transfer.","RNA viruses; phytoplankton mortality; viral ecology; pyrosequencing; and viral diversity; Picomavirales","Microbiology","2014"

However, the distribution and functional diversity of CRISPRs among environmental bacteria remains largely unknown. Here, comparative genomics of 75 Salinispora strains provided insight into the diversity and distribution of CRISPR-Cas systems in a cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus. Results: CRISPRs were found in all Salinispora strains, with the majority containing multiple loci and different Cas array subtypes. Of the six subtypes identified, three have not been previously described. A lower prophage frequency in S. arenicola was associated with a higher fraction of spacers matching Salinispora prophages compared to S. tropica, suggesting differing defensive capacities between Salinispora species. The occurrence of related prophages in strains from distant locations, as well as spacers matching those prophages inserted throughout spacer arrays, indicate recurring encounters with widely distributed phages over time. Linkages of CRISPR features with Salinispora microdiversity pointed to subclade-specific contacts with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This included lineage-specific spacer deletions or insertions, which may reflect weak selective pressures to maintain immunity or distinct temporal interactions with MGEs, respectively. Biogeographic patterns in spacer and prophage distributions support the concept that Salinispora spp. encounter localized MGEs. Moreover, the presence of spacers matching housekeeping genes suggests that CRISPRs may have functions outside of viral defense. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive examination of CRISPR-Cas systems in a broadly distributed group of environmental bacteria. The ubiquity and diversity of CRISPRs in Salinispora suggests that CRISPR-mediated interactions with MGEs represent a major force in the ecology and evolution of this cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus.","Salinispora; CRISPR-Cas; Prophages; Mobile genetic elements; Immunity; and Evolution","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity","2014"

The archetypal representative of this evolving putative family is Mimivirus, an opportunistic pathogen of Acanthamoeba spp. originally thought to be a bacterium until its genome sequence was published in 2004. Subsequent analysis of marine metagenomic data revealed Megaviruses are likely ubiquitous on the surface ocean. Analysis of genome sequences of giant viruses isolated from naturally occurring marine protists such as microalgae and a microflagellate grazer, started the expansion of the Megaviridae. Here, we explored the possibility of developing Megavirus specific markers for mutS that could be used in virus molecular ecology studies. MutS is split into 15 different clades representing a wide range of cellular life, and two that contain Megaviruses, clade MutS7 and clade MutS8. We developed specific PCR primers that recognized Megavirus clade MutS8, a clade that we propose discriminates most of the algal Megaviruses. Analysis of seawater off the coast of Maine, US, revealed novel groups of algal Megaviruses that were present in all samples tested. The Megavirus clade MutS8 marker should be considered as a tool to reveal new diversity and distribution of this enigmatic group of viruses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Despite this importance, microbial diversity is only now being mapped at scales relevant to nature(5), while the viral diversity associated with any particular host remains little researched. Here we quantify host-associated viral diversity using viral-tagged metagenomics, which links viruses to specific host cells for high-throughput screening and sequencing. In a single experiment, we screened 10(7) Pacific Ocean viruses against a single strain of Synechococcus and found that naturally occurring cyanophage genome sequence space is statistically clustered into discrete populations. These population-based, host-linked viral ecological data suggest that, for this single host and seawater sample alone, there are at least 26 double-stranded DNA viral populations with estimated relative abundances ranging from 0.06 to 18.2%. These populations include previously cultivated cyanophage and new viral types missed by decades of isolate-based studies. Nucleotide identities of homologous genes mostly varied by less than 1% within populations, even in hypervariable genome regions, and by 42-71% between populations, which provides benchmarks for viral metagenomics and genome-based viral species definitions.

However, we have little understanding of how habitat isolation affects the communities containing disease vectors. Here, we test the effects of habitat type and isolation on the colonization rates, species richness and abundances of mosquitoes and their aquatic predators in water-filled containers in northwestern Thailand. For eight weeks water-filled containers were monitored in areas containing forest, urban and agricultural habitats and mixtures of these three. Mosquito larvae of the genera Aedes and Culex appeared to be differentially affected by the presence of the dominant predator; Toxorhynchites splendens (Culicidae). Therefore, a predation experiment was conducted to determine predator response to prey density and its relative effects on different mosquito prey populations. Colonization rates, species richness and abundances of mosquito predators were strongly related to forest habitat and to the distance from other aquatic habitats. Areas with more tree cover had higher predator species richness and abundance in containers. Containers that were close to surface water were more rapidly colonized than those further away. In all habitat types, including urban areas, when predators were present, the number of mosquito larvae was much tower. Containers in urban areas closer to water-bodies, or with more canopy cover, had higher predator colonization rates and species richness. T spiendens (Culicidae) preyed on the larvae of two mosquito genera at different rates, which appeared to be related to prey behaviour. This study shows that anthropogenic landscape modification has an important effect on the natural biological control of mosquitoes. Vector control programmes and urban planning should attempt to integrate ecological theory when developing strategies to reduce mosquito populations. This would result in management strategies that are beneficial for both public health and biodiversity. (C) 2014 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Infection frequencies suggest that similar to 1/3 of SUP05 bacteria are viral-infected, with higher infection frequency where oxygen-deficiency was most severe. Observed Microviridae clonality suggests recovery of bloom-terminating viruses, while systematic co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses posits previously unrecognized cooperation modes. Analyses of 186 microbial and viral metagenomes revealed that SUP05 viruses persisted for years, but remained endemic to the OMZ. Finally, identification of virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase suggests SUP05 viruses reprogram their host's energy metabolism.

Relative to our understanding of Salmonella diversity, our understanding of the global diversity of Salmonella phages is limited. We hypothesized that the serovar diversity in a given environment and farming system will affect the Salmonella phage diversity associated with animal hosts. We thus isolated and characterized Salmonella phages from 15 small-scale dairy farms in Thailand and compared the host ranges of the 62 Salmonella phage isolates obtained with host range diversity for 129 phage isolates obtained from dairy farms in the U.S. The 62 phage isolates from Thailand represented genome sizes ranging from 40 to 200 kb and showed lysis of 6-25 of the 26 host strains tested (mean number of strain lysed = 19). By comparison, phage isolates previously obtained in a survey of 15 U.S. dairy farms showed a narrow host range (lysis of 1-17; mean number of strains lysed = 4); principal coordinate analysis also confirmed U.S. and Thai phages had distinct host lysis profiles. Our data indicate that dairy farms that differ in management practices and are located on different continents can yield phage isolates that differ in their host ranges, providing an avenue for isolation of phages with desirable host range characteristics for commercial applications.

However, the role that viruses have in influencing microbial mortality and microbial community structure is poorly understood. Here we investigated the production of viruses and change in microbial community structure within shallow alluvial aquifer sediment slurries amended with C-13-labeled acetate and nitrate. Biostimulation resulted in production of viruses concurrent with acetate oxidation, (CO2)-C-13 production and nitrate reduction. Interestingly, change in viral abundance was positively correlated to acetate consumption (r(2) = 0.6252, P<0.05) and (CO2)-C-13 production (r(2) = 0.6572, P<0.05); whereas change in cell abundance was not correlated to acetate consumption or (CO2)-C-13 production. Viral-mediated cell lysis has implications for microbial community structure. Betaproteobacteria predominated microbial community composition (62% of paired-end reads) upon inoculation but decreased in relative abundance and was negatively correlated to changes in viral abundance (r(2) = 0.5036, P<0.05). As members of the Betaproteobacteria decreased, Gammaproteobacteria, specifically Pseudomonas spp., increased in relative abundance (82% of paired-end reads) and was positively correlated with the change in viral abundance (r(2) = 0.5368, P<0.05). A nitrate-reducing bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain Alda10, was isolated from these sediments and produced viral-like particles with a filamentous morphology that did not result in cell lysis. Together, these results indicate that viruses are linked to carbon biogeochemistry and community structure in terrestrial subsurface sediments. The subsequent cell lysis has the potential to alter available carbon pools in subsurface environments, additionally controlling microbial community structure from the bottom-up.","carbon cycle; nitrate; subsurface microbial ecology; viruses","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology","2014"

To explore the replication efficiency of betanodaviruses with different genomes in relation to temperature and to understand the role of genetic reassortment on viral phenotype, RGNNV, SJNNV, RGNNV/SJNNV and RGNNV/SJNNV field isolates were fully sequenced, and growth curves generated in vitro at four different temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 degrees C) were developed for each isolate. The data obtained, corroborated by statistical analysis, demonstrated that viral titres of diverse betanodavirus genotypes varied significantly in relation to the incubation temperature of the culture. In particular, at 30 degrees C betanodaviruses under investigation presented different phenotypes, and viruses containing the RNA1 of the RGNNV genotype showed the best replication efficiency. Laboratory results demonstrated that viruses clustering within the same genotype based on the polymerase gene, possess similar growth kinetics in response to temperature, thus highlighting the key role of RNA1 in controlling viral replication at different environmental conditions.

While demonstrated in many insects, the contribution of bacterial symbionts in Aedes ecology is a challenging aspect that needs to be investigated. Also some bacterial species have already been identified in Ae. albopictus using classical methods, but a more accurate survey of mosquito-associated bacterial diversity is needed to decipher the potential biological functions of bacterial symbionts in mediating or constraining insect adaptation. We surveyed the bacteria associated with field populations of Ae. albopictus from Madagascar by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Different aspects of amplicon preparation and sequencing depth were tested to optimize the breadth of bacterial diversity identified. The results revealed that all mosquitoes collected from different sites have a bacterial microbiota dominated by a single taxon, Wolbachia pipientis, which accounted for about 99% of all 92,615 sequences obtained. As Ae. albopictus is known to harbor two Wolbachia strains (wAlbA and wAlbB), a quantitative PCR was used to estimate the relative densities, (i.e., the bacteria-to-host gene ratios) of each strains in individual mosquitoes. Relative densities were between 6.25 x 10(0.01) and 5.47 x 10(0.1) for wAlbA and between 2.03 x 10(0.1) and 1.4 x 10(1) for wAlbB. Apart from Wolbachia, a total of 31 bacterial taxa were identified at the genus level using different method variations. Diversity index values were low and probably underestimated the true diversity due to the high abundance of Wolbachia sequences vastly outnumbering sequences from other taxa.

We demonstrate this empirically using bacteriophage (phage) from an evolution experiment where spatial structure was maintained over 550 phage generations on agar plates. We found that a single substitution in the major capsid protein led to slower adsorption of phage to host cells with no change in lysis time or burst size. Plaques formed by phage isolates containing this mutation were not only larger but also contained more phage per unit area. Using a spatially explicit, individual-based model, we showed that when there is a trade-off between adsorption and diffusion (i.e. less 'sticky' phage diffuse further), slow adsorption can maximize plaque size, plaque density and overall productivity. These findings suggest that less infective pathogens may have an advantage in spatially structured populations, even when well-mixed models predict that they will not.","spatial structure; bacteriophages; evolution; adsorption","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & and Ecology; Evolutionary Biology","2014"

AIV can remain viable for an extended time in water; however, little is known regarding the influence of the biotic community (i.e., aquatic invertebrates) on virus persistence and infectivity in aquatic environments. We conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the ability of an aquatic filter-feeding invertebrate, Daphnia magna, to accumulate virus from AIV-dosed water under the hypothesis that they represent a potential vector of AIV to waterfowl hosts. We placed live daphnids in test tubes dosed with low-pathogenicity AIV (H3N8 subtype isolated from a wild duck) and sampled Daphnia tissue and the surrounding water using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at 3-to 120-min intervals for up to 960 min following dosing. Concentrations of viral RNA averaged 3 times higher in Daphnia tissue than the surrounding water shortly after viral exposure, but concentrations decreased exponentially through time for both. Extracts from Daphnia tissue were negative for AIV by cell culture, whereas AIV remained viable in water without Daphnia present. Our results suggest daphnids can accumulate AIV RNA and effectively remove virus particles from water. Although concentrations of viral RNA were consistently higher in Daphnia tissue than the water, additional research is needed on the time scale of AIV inactivation after Daphnia ingestion to fully elucidate Daphnia's role as a potential vector of AIV infection to aquatic birds.",NA,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2013"

However, obtaining a thorough understanding of marine phages has been hampered by the low number of phage isolates infecting major bacterial groups other than cyanophages and pelagiphages. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for the isolation of phages that infect abundant marine bacterial groups. In this study, we isolated and characterized HMO-2011, a phage infecting a bacterium of the SAR116 clade, one of the most abundant marine bacterial lineages. HMO-2011, which infects ""Candidatus Puniceispirillum marinum"" strain IMCC1322, has an similar to 55-kb dsDNA genome that harbors many genes with novel features rarely found in cultured organisms, including genes encoding a DNA polymerase with a partial DnaJ central domain and an atypical methanesulfonate monooxygenase. Furthermore, homologs of nearly all HMO-2011 genes were predominantly found in marine metagenomes rather than cultured organisms, suggesting the novelty of HMO-2011 and the prevalence of this phage type in the oceans. A significant number of the viral metagenome sequences obtained from the ocean surface were best assigned to the HMO-2011 genome. The number of reads assigned to HMO-2011 accounted for 10.3%-25.3% of the total reads assigned to viruses in seven viromes from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, making the HMO-2011 genome the most or second-most frequently assigned viral genome.

Results: Classification of the 22 phages according to the presence/absence of orthologous genes allowed for classification into 8 well supported clusters. In addition to two phage clusters that represent novel virulent Salmonella phages, we also identified four phage clusters that each contained previously characterized phages from multiple continents. Our analyses also identified two clusters of phages that carry putative virulence (e. g., adhesins) and antimicrobial resistance (tellurite and bicyclomycin) genes as well as virulent and temperate transducing phages. Insights into phage evolution from our analyses include (i) identification of DNA metabolism genes that may facilitate nucleotide synthesis in phages with a G+C % distinct from Salmonella, and (ii) evidence of Salmonella phage tailspike and fiber diversity due to both single nucleotide polymorphisms and major re-arrangements, which may affect the host specificity of Salmonella phages. Conclusions: Genomics-based characterization of 22 Salmonella phages isolated from dairy farms allowed for identification of a number of novel Salmonella phages. While the comparative genomics analyses of these phages provide a number of new insights in the evolution and diversity of Salmonella phages, they only represent a first glimpse into the diversity of Salmonella phages that is likely to be discovered when phages from different environments are characterized.","Salmonella phage; Phage genomics","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity","2013"

Due to bacterial overgrowth and susceptibility to high concentrations of antibiotics, isolation by amoeba co-culture has a low efficiency and is highly time-consuming. Thus, few environments have been exhaustively investigated to date, although the ubiquitous distribution of the Acanthamoeba sp. suggests that these viruses could also be ubiquitous. In this work, we have implemented a high-throughput method to detect amoebae lysis on agar plates that allows the testing of hundreds of samples in a few days. Using this procedure, a total of 11 new Marseilleviridae strains and four new Mimiviridae strains, including a virus infected with a virophage, were isolated from 1000 environmental samples from Tunisia. Of these, four corresponded to new genotypic variants. These isolates are the first African environmental isolates identified from these two families, and several samples were obtained from a hypersaline aquatic environment. These results demonstrate that this technique can be used for the evaluation and characterization of large collections of giant viruses to provide insight into understanding their ecology.",NA,"Microbiology","2013"

Coastal aquatic habitats have long been known to provide suitable habitats for brackish-water mosquitoes and historically, coastal marshes were considered to support anopheline mosquito populations that were responsible for local malaria transmission. This study surveyed the eight largest managed realignment (MRA) sites in England (Essex and the Humber) for mosquito habitats. The apparent absence of anopheline mosquitoes exploiting aquatic habitats at all of these sites suggests that the risk of malaria associated with MRA sites is currently negligible. However, three of the eight sites supported populations of two nuisance and potential arboviral vector species, Aedes detritus and Aedes caspius. The aquatic habitats that supported mosquitoes resulted from a) specific design aspects of the new sea wall (ballast to mitigate wave action and constructed saline borrow ditches) that could be designed out or managed or b) isolated pools created through silt accretion or expansion of flooded zones to neighbouring pasture. The public health risks and recommendations for management are discussed in this report. This report highlights the need for pro-active public health impact assessments prior to MRA development in consultation with the Health Protection Agency, as well as the need for a case-by-case approach to design and management to mitigate mosquito or mosquito-borne disease issues now and in the future.","Climate; mosquitoes; wetlands; ecology; control; Aedes","Entomology","2013"

At the end of the infection cycle, progeny virions are confronted with a rigid cell wall that hinders their release into the environment and the opportunity to start a new infection cycle. Consequently, phages encode hydrolytic enzymes, called endolysins, to digest the peptidoglycan.

In the present study, we report the isolation of novel HcRNAV clones (n=51) lytic to the H. circularisquama strains, HU9433-P, HCLG-1, 05HC05 and 05HC06. HcRNAV34, HcRNAV109, HcRNAV641, and HcRNAV659, which displayed lytic activity against the strains, HU9433-P, HCLG-1, 05HC05, and 05HC06, respectively, were selected as typical virus clones and were intensively examined. The infection intensity of each host-virus combination was analyzed by examining the algicidal activity, detecting the intracellular replication of the viral RNA as well as the appearance of host cells with a morphologically abnormal nucleus post-infection. Interestingly, the strains, 05HC05 and 05HC06, were markedly sensitive to HcRNAV641 and HcRNAV659, respectively. Tertiary structural modeling predicted 4 unique amino acid (aa) substitutions in HcRNAV659-MCP to be exposed to an ambient water environment, which contributed towards determining its infection specificity. Neighbor-joining analysis of MCP aa sequences from HcRNAV clones revealed 3 clades, namely, the CY type and the UA1 and UA2 subtypes. The HcRNAV clones lytic to HCLG-1 (ex.

Alternatively, the evolution of high surface-to-volume ratios coupled with minimal genomes containing high-affinity transporters enables unusually efficient metabolism for oxidizing dissolved organic matter in the world's oceans that could support vast population sizes despite phage susceptibility. These ideas are important for understanding plankton ecology because they emphasize the potentially important role of top-down mechanisms in predation, thus determining the size of SAR11 populations and their concomitant role in biogeochemical cycling. Here we report the isolation of diverse SAR11 viruses belonging to two virus families in culture, for which we propose the name 'pelagiphage', after their host. Notably; the pelagiphage genomes were highly represented in marine viral metagenomes, demonstrating their importance in nature. One of the new phages, HTVC010P, represents a new podovirus subfamily more abundant than any seen previously, in all data sets tested, and may represent one of the most abundant virus subfamilies in the biosphere. This discovery disproves the theory that SAR11 cells are immune to viral predation and is consistent with the interpretation that the success of this highly abundant microbial clade is the result of successfully evolved adaptation to resource competition.",NA,"Science & Technology - Other Topics","2013"

Yet, little is known about the relative activities of different microbial populations within genetically diverse communities. We used rRNA as a proxy for activity to quantify the relative specific activities (rRNA/ribosomal DNA [rDNA or rRNA genes]) of the eubacterial populations and to identify locations or clades for which there are uncouplings between specific activity and abundance. After analyzing 1.6 million sequences from 16S rDNA and rRNA (cDNA) libraries from two euphotic depths from a representative site in the Pacific Ocean, we show that although there is an overall positive relationship between the abundances (rDNAs) and activities (rRNAs) among populations of the bacterial community, for some populations these measures are uncoupled. Different ecological strategies are exemplified by the two numerically dominant clades at this site: the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is abundant but disproportionately more active, while the heterotrophic SAR11 is abundant but less active. Other rare populations, such as Alteromonas, have high specific activities in spite of their low abundances, suggesting intense population regulation. More detailed analyses using a complementary quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based approach of measuring relative specific activity for Prochlorococcus populations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans also show that specific activity, but not abundance, reflects the key drivers of light and nutrients in this system; our results also suggest substantial top-down regulation (e.g., grazing, viruses, or organismal interactions) or transport (e.g., mixing, immigration, or emigration) of these populations. Thus, we show here that abundance and specific activity can be uncoupled in open ocean systems and that describing both is critical to characterizing microbial communities and predicting marine ecosystem functioning and responses to change.",NA,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2013"

To better understand the ecology and diversity of listeriaphages on dairy farms and to develop a diverse phage collection for further studies, silage samples collected on two dairy farms were screened for L. monocytogenes and listeriaphages. While only 4.5% of silage samples tested positive for L. monocytogenes, 47.8% of samples were positive for listeriaphages, containing up to >1.5 x 10(4) PFU/g. Host range characterization of the 114 phage isolates obtained, with a reference set of 13 L. monocytogenes strains representing the nine major serotypes and four lineages, revealed considerable host range diversity; phage isolates were classified into nine lysis groups. While one serotype 3c strain was not lysed by any phage isolates, serotype 4 strains were highly susceptible to phages and were lysed by 63.2 to 88.6% of phages tested. Overall, 12.3% of phage isolates showed a narrow host range (lysing 1 to 5 strains), while 28.9% of phages represented broad host range (lysing >= 11 strains). Genome sizes of the phage isolates were estimated to range from approximately 26 to 140 kb. The extensive host range and genomic diversity of phages observed here suggest an important role of phages in the ecology of L. monocytogenes on dairy farms.

This behavior can bridge arboviral transmission across different vertebrate groups. Our study examined the host preference of Cx. erraticus at Sonso Lake in Colombia. From July to August 2008, blood-engorged mosquitoes were collected from resting boxes, while vertebrate abundance was determined to calculate host preference. Based on mitochondrial DNA analysis of bloodmeals, birds were the predominant hosts (57.6%), followed by mammals (30.8%), and reptiles (6.7%); 9.5% of the bloodmeals were mixed. The most commonly fed upon species were: limpkin, black-crowned nightheron, striated heron, human, and capybara. Forage ratios showed the least bittern, limpkin, Cocoi heron, striated heron, capybara, and black-crowned night heron were preferred hosts across all vertebrates. Of the available avifauna, the least bittern, limpkin, striated heron, Cocoi heron, and black-crowned night heron were preferred, whereas the bare faced ibis, great egret, snowy egret, and cattle egret were under-used.

A dataset of 125 highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV isolated in Vietnam from 2003 to 2007 is used to explore which population and environment variables are correlated with increased genetic change among viruses. Results from non-parametric multidimensional scaling and regression analyses indicate that variables relating to both the environmental and social ecology of humans and birds in Vietnam interact to affect the genetic character of viruses. These findings suggest that it is a combination of suitable environments for species mixing, the presence of high numbers of potential hosts, and in particular the temporal characteristics of viral occurrence, that drive genetic change among H5N1 AIV in Vietnam.

The aim of this work was to determine Salmonella presence in river water with an ultrafiltration system coupled with the ISO 6579:1993 isolation standard method (UFS-ISO). Most probable number (MPN) method was used directly in water samples to estimate Salmonella populations. Additionally, the effect between Salmonella determination and water turbidity was evaluated. Ten liters or three tenfold dilutions (1, 0.1, and 0.01 mL) of water were processed for Salmonella detection and estimation by the UFS-ISO and MPN methods, respectively. A total of 84 water samples were tested, and Salmonella was confirmed in 64/84 (76%) and 38/84 (44%) when UFS-ISO and MPN were used, respectively. Salmonella populations were less than 5 x 10(3) MPN/L in 73/84 of samples evaluated (87%), and only three (3.5%) showed contamination with numbers greater than 4.5 x 10(4) MPN/L. Water turbidity did not affect Salmonella determination regardless of the performed method. These findings suggest that Salmonella abundance in Sinaloa rivers is not a health risk for human infections in spite of its persistence.

"177","Polymorphic toxin systems: Comprehensive characterization of trafficking modes, processing, mechanisms of action, immunity and ecology using comparative genomics","Zhang, DP and de Souza, RF and Anantharaman, V and Iyer, LM and Aravind, L","BIOLOGY DIRECT","Background: Proteinaceous toxins are observed across all levels of inter-organismal and intra-genomic conflicts. These include recently discovered prokaryotic polymorphic toxin systems implicated in intra-specific conflicts. They are characterized by a remarkable diversity of C-terminal toxin domains generated by recombination with standalone toxin-coding cassettes. Prior analysis revealed a striking diversity of nuclease and deaminase domains among the toxin modules. We systematically investigated polymorphic toxin systems using comparative genomics, sequence and structure analysis. Results: Polymorphic toxin systems are distributed across all major bacterial lineages and are delivered by at least eight distinct secretory systems. In addition to type-II, these include type-V, VI, VII (ESX), and the poorly characterized ""Photorhabdus virulence cassettes (PVC)"", PrsW-dependent and MuF phage-capsid-like systems. We present evidence that trafficking of these toxins is often accompanied by autoproteolytic processing catalyzed by HINT, ZU5, PrsW, caspase-like, papain-like, and a novel metallopeptidase associated with the PVC system. We identified over 150 distinct toxin domains in these systems. These span an extraordinary catalytic spectrum to include 23 distinct clades of peptidases, numerous previously unrecognized versions of nucleases and deaminases, ADP-ribosyltransferases, ADP ribosyl cyclases, RelA/SpoT-like nucleotidyltransferases, glycosyltranferases and other enzymes predicted to modify lipids and carbohydrates, and a pore-forming toxin domain. Several of these toxin domains are shared with host-directed effectors of pathogenic bacteria. Over 90 families of immunity proteins might neutralize anywhere between a single to at least 27 distinct types of toxin domains. In some organisms multiple tandem immunity genes or immunity protein domains are organized into polyimmunity loci or polyimmunity proteins. Gene-neighborhood-analysis of polymorphic toxin systems predicts the presence of novel trafficking-related components, and also the organizational logic that allows toxin diversification through recombination. Domain architecture and protein-length analysis revealed that these toxins might be deployed as secreted factors, through directed injection, or via inter-cellular contact facilitated by filamentous structures formed by RHS/YD, filamentous hemagglutinin and other repeats. Phyletic pattern and life-style analysis indicate that polymorphic toxins and polyimmunity loci participate in cooperative behavior and facultative 'cheating' in several ecosystems such as the human oral cavity and soil. Multiple domains from these systems have also been repeatedly transferred to eukaryotes and their viruses, such as the nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses. Conclusions: Along with a comprehensive inventory of toxins and immunity proteins, we present several testable predictions regarding active sites and catalytic mechanisms of toxins, their processing and trafficking and their role in intra-specific and inter-specific interactions between bacteria. These systems provide insights regarding the emergence of key systems at different points in eukaryotic evolution, such as ADP ribosylation, interaction of myosin VI with cargo proteins, mediation of apoptosis, hyphal heteroincompatibility, hedgehog signaling, arthropod toxins, cell-cell interaction molecules like teneurins and different signaling messengers.",NA,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics","2012"

Plasmids often serve as mediators of lateral gene transfer, a process considered to be a strong and sculpting evolutionary force in microbial environments. Our aim was to characterize the overall plasmid population in the environment of the bovine rumen, which houses a complex and dense microbiota that holds enormous significance for humans. We developed a procedure for the isolation of total rumen plasmid DNA, termed rumen plasmidome, and subjected it to deep sequencing using the Illumina paired-end protocol and analysis using public and custom-made bioinformatics tools. A large number of plasmidome contigs aligned with plasmids of rumen bacteria isolated from different locations and at various time points, suggesting that not only the bacterial taxa, but also their plasmids, are defined by the ecological niche. The bacterial phylum distribution of the plasmidome was different from that of the rumen bacterial taxa. Nevertheless, both shared a dominance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Evidently, the rumen plasmidome is of a highly mosaic nature that can cross phyla. Interestingly, when we compared the functional profile of the rumen plasmidome to two plasmid databases and two recently published rumen metagenomes, it became apparent that the rumen plasmidome codes for functions, which are enriched in the rumen ecological niche and could confer advantages to their hosts, suggesting that the functional profiles of mobile genetic elements are associated with their environment, as has been previously implied for viruses.","metagenomics; microbial ecology; rumen microbiology","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2012"

Vibrio cholerae was isolated from 59.5% of water and plankton samples (n = 357) and 35.5% of stool samples (n = 290). Isolation from water was dependent on air (r = 0 44) and water temperatures (r = 0 49) (P < 0 01) but was independent of rainfall (r = 0 15), chlorophyll a (r = 0 18), salinity (r = 0 2) or pH (r = 0 2) (P > 0 05). Isolation from plankton was dependent on temperature of air (r = 0 45), water temperature (r = 0 44), chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0 42), pH (r = 0 23) and salinity (r = 0 39) (P < 0 01). Cholera cases correlated with rainfall (r = 0 82, P < 0 01) and chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0 42, P < 0 05), but not with air temperature (r = 0 3, P = 0 37).

Despite their impact on biogeochemical cycling, the transcriptional dynamics of these important oceanic events is still poorly understood. Here, we employ an oligonucleotide microarray to monitor host (Emiliania huxleyi) and virus (coccolithovirus) transcriptomic features during the course of E. huxleyi blooms induced in seawater-based mesocosm enclosures. Host bloom development and subsequent coccolithovirus infection was associated with a major shift in transcriptional profile. In addition to the expected metabolic requirements typically associated with viral infection (amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, as well as transcription- and replication-associated functions), the results strongly suggest that the manipulation of lipid metabolism plays a fundamental role during hostvirus interaction. The results herein reveal the scale, so far massively underestimated, of the transcriptional domination that occurs during coccolithovirus infection in the natural environment.","host-virus interactions; functional genomics; Phycodnaviridae; marine and microbial ecology; marine transcriptomics","Microbiology","2011"

Genomic analysis of several strains has revealed an extensive H. pylori pan-genome, likely to grow as more genomes are sampled. Here we describe the draft genome sequence (63 contigs; 26x mean coverage) of H. pylori strain B45, isolated from a patient with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The major finding was a 24.6-kb prophage integrated in the bacterial genome. The prophage shares most of its genes (22/27) with prophage region II of Helicobacter acinonychis strain Sheeba. After UV treatment of liquid cultures, circular DNA carrying the prophage integrase gene could be detected, and intracellular tailed phage-like particles were observed in H. pylori cells by transmission electron microscopy, indicating that phage production can be induced from the prophage. PCR amplification and sequencing of the integrase gene from 341 H. pylori strains from different geographic regions revealed a high prevalence of the prophage (21.4%). Phylogenetic reconstruction showed four distinct clusters in the integrase gene, three of which tended to be specific for geographic regions. Our study implies that phages may play important roles in the ecology and evolution of H. pylori. IMPORTANCE Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the gastric mucosa in more than half of the human population, and while most of the infected individuals do not develop disease, H. pylori infection doubles the risk of developing gastric cancer. An abundance and diversity of viruses (phages) infect microbial populations in most environments and are important mediators of microbial diversity. Our finding of a 24.6-kb prophage integrated inside an H. pylori genome and the observation of circular integrase gene-containing DNA and phage-like particles inside cells upon UV treatment demonstrate that we have discovered a viable H. pylori phage. The additional finding of integrase genes in a large proportion of screened isolates of diverse geographic origins indicates that the prevalence of prophages may have been underestimated in H. pylori. Since phages are important drivers of microbial evolution, the discovery should be important for understanding and predicting genetic diversity in H. pylori.",NA,"Microbiology","2011"

To address this problem, we analyze the viral metagenome of a northeast Pacific hydrothermal vent with a comprehensive database of spacers derived from the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) putative immune system. CRISPR spacer matches to the marine vent virome suggest that viruses infecting hosts from diverse taxonomic groups are present in this vent environment. Comparative virome analyses show that CRISPR spacers from vent isolates and from thermophiles in general have a higher percentage of matches to the vent virome than to other marine or terrestrial hot spring viromes. However, a high percentage of hits to spacers from mesophilic hosts, combined with a moderately high modeled alpha diversity, suggest that the marine vent virome is comprised of viruses that have the potential to infect diverse taxonomic groups of multiple thermal regimes in both the bacterial and the archaeal domains.","viral ecology; metagenome; hydrothermal vent ecology","Microbiology","2011"

Most viruses have not been cultivated and cultivation-independent means to explore viral diversity have provided only a fragmented view of viral genomic information. In this study, ultracentrifugation and chromatographic methods were evaluated for their ability to fractionate aquatic viruses based on their differing physical properties with the aim of physically enriching subsets of aquatic viruses for further study. Centrifugation in continuous cesium chloride gradients, strong and weak anion-exchange chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography with Sephacryl S-1000 were found to separate aquatic viruses based on their differing buoyant densities, surface charges, and sizes, respectively. Sucrose density gradients, cation-exchange chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography using controlled-pore glass were found to have insufficient resolution to effectively separate viral assemblages. Using the successful methods listed above, we were able to separate complex assemblages of viruses into fractions that had distinguishable subsets of the viruses present in the original community as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Strong anion-exchange chromatography was particularly effective at separating viruses in the samples and resulted in one to six dominant viral genome bands in most fractions. Our results suggest that individual populations of viruses may be physically enriched, and possibly isolated, from complex assemblages without cultivation. These fractionation methods are expected to improve our ability to characterize the genotypes and phenotypes of the uncultivated majority of viruses in aquatic environments.",NA,"Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2011"

In soil and marine environments, microorganism-infecting phages are the most common type of virus. Although several types of bacteriophage have been isolated from fermented foods, little is known about the overall viral assemblages (viromes) of these environments. In this study, metagenomic analyses were performed on the uncultivated viral communities from three fermented foods, fermented shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique, a total of 81,831, 70,591 and 69,464 viral sequences were obtained from fermented shrimp, kimchi and sauerkraut, respectively. Moreover, 37 to 50% of these sequences showed no significant hit against sequences in public databases. There were some discrepancies between the prediction of bacteriophages hosts via homology comparison and bacterial distribution, as determined from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These discrepancies likely reflect the fact that the viral genomes of fermented foods are poorly represented in public databases. Double-stranded DNA viral communities were amplified from fermented foods by using a linker-amplified shotgun library. These communities were dominated by bacteriophages belonging to the viral order Caudovirales (i.e., Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae). This study indicates that fermented foods contain less complex viral communities than many other environmental habitats, such as seawater, human feces, marine sediment, and soil.",NA,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2011"

We analysed these sequences, along with previously published marine prokaryotic genomes, in the context of marine metagenomic data, to gain insights into the ecology of the surface ocean prokaryotic picoplankton (0.1-3.0 mu m size range). The results suggest that the sequenced genomes define two microbial groups: one composed of only a few taxa that are nearly always abundant in picoplanktonic communities, and the other consisting of many microbial taxa that are rarely abundant. The genomic content of the second group suggests that these microbes are capable of slow growth and survival in energy-limited environments, and rapid growth in energy-rich environments. By contrast, the abundant and cosmopolitan picoplanktonic prokaryotes for which there is genomic representation have smaller genomes, are probably capable of only slow growth and seem to be relatively unable to sense or rapidly acclimate to energy-rich conditions.

Abundance, production and respiration of prokaryotes reflect supplies of particulate and dissolved organic matter to the bathypelagic zone. Better resolution of carbon fluxes mediated by deep microbes requires further testing on the validity of conversion factors. Archaea, especially marine Crenarchaeota Group I, are abundant in deep waters where they can fix dissolved inorganic carbon. Viruses appear to be important in the microbial loop in deep waters, displaying remarkably high virus to prokaryote abundance ratios in some oceanic regions. Sequencing of 18S rRNA genes revealed a tremendous diversity of small-sized protists in bathypelagic waters. Abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates decrease with depth more steeply than prokaryotes; nonetheless, data indicated that HNF consumed half of prokaryote production in the bathypelagic zone. Aggregates are important habitats for deep-water microbes, which produce more extracellular enzymes (on a per-cell basis) than surface communities. The theory of marine gel formation provides a framework to unravel complex interactions between microbes and organic polymers. Recent data on the effects of hydrostatic pressure on microbial activities indicate that bathypelagic microbial activity is generally higher under in situ pressure conditions than at atmospheric pressures. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed a remarkable diversity of Bacteria in the bathypelagic ocean. Metagenomics and comparative genomics of piezophiles reveal not only the high diversity of deep sea microbes but also specific functional attributes of these piezophilic microbes, interpreted as an adaptation to the deep water environment. Taken together, the data compiled on bathypelagic microbes indicate that, despite high-pressure and low-temperature conditions, microbes in the bathypelagic ocean dynamically interact with complex mixtures of organic matter, responding to changes in the ocean's biogeochemical state.

Specifically, our experiments address (i) the ability of environmental Escherichia coli (E. coli) to serve as hosts for coliphage replication, and (ii) the temporal and spatial distribution of coliphages in coastal waters. Methods and Results: Water samples from three locations in California's Newport Bay watershed were tested for the presence of coliphages every 2 weeks for an entire year. A total of nine E. coli strains isolated from various sources served as hosts for coliphage detection. Coliphage occurrence was significantly different between freshwater, estuarine and coastal locations and correlated with water temperature, salinity and rainfall in the watershed. The coliphages isolated on the environmental hosts had a broad host-range relative to the coliphages isolated on an E. coli strain from sewage and a US EPA recommended strain for coliphage detection. Conclusions: Coliphage occurrence was related to the temperature, rainfall and salinity within the bay. The adaptation to a broad host-range may enable the proliferation of coliphages in the aquatic environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: Understanding the seasonal variation of phages is useful for establishing a background level of coliphage presence in coastal waters.

The NS3 gene has a high level of substitutions and is phylogenetically informative. Likewise, substitutions in the envelope region have been postulated to enable viruses to subvert immune responses. Analysis of these genes among isolates from positive mosquitoes collected in Louisiana illustrates the variation present in the regions and provides improved insight to a phylogenetic model. Employing a GIS eco-regionalization method, we hypothesized that WNV pool positivity was correlated with regional environmental characteristics. Further, we postulated that the phylogenetic delineations would be associated with variations in regional environmental conditions. Results: Type of regional land cover was a significant effect (p < 0.0001) in the positive pool prediction, indicating that there is an ecological component driving WNV activity. Additionally, month of collection was significant (p < 0.0001); and thus there is a temporal component that contributes to the probability of getting a positive mosquito pool. All virus isolates are of the WNV 2002 lineage. There appears to be some diversity within both forested and wetland areas; and the possibility of a distinct clade in the wetland samples. Conclusions: The phylogenetic analysis shows that there has been no reversion in Louisiana from the 2002 lineage which replaced the originally introduced strain. Our pool positivity model serves as a basis for future testing, and could direct mosquito control and surveillance efforts. Understanding how land cover and regional ecology effects mosquito pool positivity will greatly help focus mosquito abatement efforts. This would especially help in areas where abatement programs are limited due to either funding or man power. Moreover, understanding how regional environments drive phylogenetic variation will lead to a greater understanding of the interactions between ecology and disease prevalence.",NA,"Virology","2010"

Frequent changes in the relative abundance of specific taxonomic groups were observed, which could not be explained by changes in the reactor's conditions or wastewater composition. Phage activity was proposed to drive some of the observed changes. Bacterial hosts were isolated from a biomass sample obtained towards the end of the study period, and specific phage counts were carried out for some of the isolated hosts using stored frozen biomass samples as the phage inocula. Plaque-forming unit concentrations were shown to change frequently over the study period, in correlation with changes in the relative abundance of taxonomic groups closely related by 16S rRNA gene sequence to the isolated strains. Quantitative PCR was used to verify changes in the abundance of a taxonomic group closely related to one of the isolated hosts, showing good agreement with the changes in relative abundance in the clone libraries of that group. The emerging pattern was consistent with the 'killing the winner' hypothesis, although alternative interaction mechanisms could not be ruled out. This is the first time that phage-host interactions in a complex microbial community are demonstrated over an extended period, and possibly the first in situ demonstration of 'killing the winner' stochastic behavior.

The content of lytic phages infecting the indigenous bacterium Desulfovibrio aespoeensis in Aspo groundwater was analysed using the MPN technique for phages. In four of 10 boreholes, 0.2-80 phages per ml were found at depths of 342-450 m. Isolates of lytic phages were made from five cultures.

The role of wild birds, which are the natural reservoirs for the virus, in the epidemiology of the H5N1 virus has raised great public health concern, but their role in the spread of the virus within the natural ecosystem of free-ranging terrestrial wild mammals remains unclear. In this study, we investigated H5N1 virus infection in wild pikas in an attempt to trace the circulation of the virus. Seroepidemiological surveys confirmed a natural H5N1 virus infection of wild pikas in their native environment. The hemagglutination gene of the H5N1 virus isolated from pikas reveals two distinct evolutionary clades, a mixed/Vietnam H5N1 virus sublineage (MV-like pika virus) and a wild bird Qinghai (QH)like H5N1 virus sublineage (QH-like pika virus). The amino acid residue (glutamic acid) at position 627 encoded by the PB2 gene of the MV-like pika virus was different from that of the QH-like pika virus; the residue of the MV-like pika virus was the same as that of the goose H5N1 virus (A/GS/Guangdong [GD]/1/96). Further, we discovered that in contrast to the MV-like pika virus, which is nonpathogenic to mice, the QH-like pika virus is highly pathogenic. To mimic the virus infection of pikas, we intranasally inoculated rabbits, a species closely related to pikas, with the H5N1 virus of pika origin. Our findings first demonstrate that wild pikas are mammalian hosts exposed to H5N1 subtype avian influenza viruses in the natural ecosystem and also imply a potential transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus from wild mammals into domestic mammalian hosts and humans.",NA,"Virology","2009"

Cloacal swabs were collected from hunter-killed or nesting waterfowl and shorebirds from wildlife refuges in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida during 2006 to 2008. Swab samples were inoculated into embryonated eggs followed by hemagglutination (HA) test to determine the presence of hemagglutinating agents. Antigen capture-ELISA (AC-ELISA) and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RRT-PCR) were used to detect AIV from both allantoic fluids (AF) and swab specimens of HA-positive samples. Hemagglutination inhibition test was used to detect Newcastle disease virus, another hemagglutinating virus common in wild birds. The HA-positive AF were sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory for subtyping of the isolates. Out of 825 samples tested, 19 AIV and 3 avian paramyxovirus subtypes were identified by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. Without egg passage, AC-ELISA did not detect virus, whereas matrix gene of 13 AIV were detected using RRT-PCR. When testing was done on AF, 14 were positive for influenza A by AC-ELISA and 20 by RRT-PCR. Antigen capture-ELISA did not detect influenza A when the HA titer was lower than 125, whereas RRT-PCR detected AIV from AF with HA titer as low as 4.

Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was more sensitive, specific, and cost-effective than AC-ELISA. However, to avoid false-negative results, testing should be performed on AF and not directly from cloacal swabs. Our procedures to detect AIV directly from cloacal swabs need further optimization for improved sensitivity.","avian influenza virus; wild aquatic bird; real-time reverse and transcription polymerase chain reaction; antigen capture-enzyme-linked and immunosorbent antibody assay","Agriculture","2009"

The 7.6-kb plasmid had guanine-cytosine content of 40.03% and encoded four open reading frames (ORFs) with > 100 amino acids. The predicted protein of ORF1 contained 478 amino acids showing 29% identity and 50% similarity over 309 amino acids to the integrase of Vibrio cholerae phage VP2. ORF2 encoded a putative protein of 596 amino acids, which were 23% identity and 42% similarity over 455 amino acids to the tail tape measure protein TP901 of Chromohalobacter salexigens phage. ORF3 and ORF4 encoded putative proteins of 103 and 287 amino acids, respectively, but showed no homologies to any known proteins. Further experiments indicated that a 3.2-kb fragment from EcoRI digestion could self-replicate. Analysis indicated that a sequence upstream of ORF4 had the features characteristic of theta-type replicons: AT-rich region, six potential direct repeats (iterons) spaced approximately two DNA helical turn apart (about 23 bp), two copies of 9 bp dnaA boxes, three Dam methylation sites, and five inverted repeats. Complementation experiments confirmed that the protein encoded by ORF4 was required for plasmid replication. We propose that ORF4 encode a new type of Rep protein and pMP1 is a new type of theta plasmid.","Cryptic plasmid; pMP1; Vibrio vulnificus; Theta replication","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Marine & Freshwater Biology","2009"

For more strict comparison of the diversity, this study examined g23 sequences between Novosphingobium and Sphingonionas phages and phage communities in the identical floodwater of a Japanese paddy field. The clones were obtained by applying g23-specific primers to DNA extracted from the floodwaters. Many 23 clones in the floodwater were grouped into the same clusters of Paddy Groups I-VI with g23 genes of Novosphingobium/Sphingomonas phages with some clones belonging to an additional cluster. In addition, tile remaining clones belonged to the clusters of marine clones and T4-type enterophages.

Despite this importance, the area of soil virology is understudied. Here, we report the isolation and preliminary characterisation of viruses from soils in the Dundee area of Scotland. Different virus morphotypes including tailed, polyhedral (spherical), rod shaped, filamentous and bacilliform particles were detected in the soil samples. An apparent predominance of small spherical and filamentous bacteriophages was observed, whereas tailed bacteriophages were significantly less abundant. In this report, we also present observations and characterisation of viruses from different soil functional domains surrounding wheat roots: rhizosheath, rhizosphere and bulk soil. In spite of the differences in abundance of bacterial communities in these domains, no significant variations in viral population structure in terms of morphology and abundance were found. Typically, there were approximately 1.1-1.2 x 10(9) virions g(-1) dry weight, implicating remarkable differences in virus-to-bacteria ratios in domains close to roots, rhizosphere and rhizosheath (approximately 0.27) and in bulk soil (approximately 4.68).","Rhizosphere; soil microbial community; viruses","Agriculture","2009"

Our understanding of phage diversity is greatly limited by the lack of useful genetic diversity measures. Previous studies, focusing on myophages that infect the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus, have used the coliphage T4 portal-protein-encoding homologue, gene 20 (g20), as a diversity marker. These studies revealed 10 sequence clusters, 9 oceanic and 1 freshwater, where only 3 contained cultured representatives. We sequenced g20 from 38 marine myophages isolated using a diversity of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus hosts to see if any would fall into the clusters that lacked cultured representatives. On the contrary, all fell into the three clusters that already contained sequences from cultured phages. Further, there was no obvious relationship between host of isolation, or host range, and g20 sequence similarity. We next expanded our analyses to all available g20 sequences (769 sequences), which include PCR amplicons from wild uncultured phages, non-PCR amplified sequences identified in the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) metagenomic database, as well as sequences from cultured phages, to evaluate the relationship between g20 sequence clusters and habitat features from which the phage sequences were isolated. Even in this meta-data set, very few sequences fell into the sequence clusters without cultured representatives, suggesting that the latter are very rare, or sequencing artefacts. In contrast, sequences most similar to the culture-containing clusters, the freshwater cluster and two novel clusters, were more highly represented, with one particular culture-containing cluster representing the dominant g20 genotype in the unamplified GOS sequence data. Finally, while some g20 sequences were non-randomly distributed with respect to habitat, there were always numerous exceptions to general patterns, indicating that phage portal proteins are not good predictors of a phage's host or the habitat in which a particular phage may thrive.",NA,"Microbiology","2008"
"207","The shape of an ecological trade-off varies with environment","Jessup, CM and Bohannan, BJM","ECOLOGY LETTERS","Central to most theories that explain the diversity of life is the concept that organisms face trade-offs. Theoretical work has shown that the precise shape of a trade-off relationship affects evolutionary predictions. One common trade-off is that between competitive ability and resistance to predators, parasitoids, pathogens or herbivores. We used a microbial experimental system to elucidate the shape of the relationship between parasitoid resistance and competitive ability. For each of 86 bacteriophage-resistant isolates of the bacterium Escherichia coli B, we measured the degree of resistance to bacteriophage T2 (a viral parasitoid) and relative competitive ability in both the resource environment in which strains were isolated and in two alternate environments. We observed that environmental change can alter trade-off shape, and that different physiological mechanisms can lead to different trade-off shapes and different sensitivities to environmental change. These results highlight the important interaction between environment and trade-off shape in affecting ecological and evolutionary dynamics.","adaptive dynamics; bacteria; bacteriophage; divergent selection; and Escherichia coli; microbial ecology; parasitoid-host; pathogen-host; and predator-prey; trade-off","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","2008"

Their spores are found together in soil and leaves and are therefore likely to commonly interact within hosts. Mixed infections of pathogenic B. thuringiensis and non-pathogenic strains have been little Studied, despite their potential impact on biological control and the evolutionary ecology of virulence. Antibiotic secreting strains of B. cereus have been shown to be able to synergize B. thuringiensis (Bt) infections. We explored the ecology of these mixed infections more broadly in the diamondback moth (DBM). We tested whether antibiotic-expressing B. cereus can synergize Bt infections initiated with spores, investigated whether ingestion of antibiotic-expressing B. cereus had any consequences for the larval gut flora and whether synergistic interactions with B. cereus increase Bt reproduction. Ingestion of high-antibiotic secreting B. cereus synergized infections of B. thuringiensis in diamondback moth larvae, but at a lower level than previously reported. Coinfection also increased slightly the number of Bt spores found in cadavers. Culture independent analysis Of gut homogenates indicated that ingestion of an antibiotic-expressing strain of B. cereus reduced the abundance of the gut flora and led to gut communities being dominated bacteria with DGGE profiles very similar to pure B. cereus Cultures. Ingestion of B. cereus, regardless of genotype, reduced densities of an enteric isolate of Enterobacter sp. These findings support the hypothesis that antibiotic secretion in the gut synergizes B. thuringiensis infections by reducing the abundance of the commensal gut flora and facilitating invasion by bacteria in the B. cereus group.

Methods and Results: Bacteria-free seawater samples containing natural viruses assemblages were inoculated with a single laboratory grown bacterial host of interest in a nutrient-enriched [peptone, Fe(III) and yeast extract] seawater suspension. These conditions enhanced the replication of only those virus(s) capable of infecting the host bacterium. After incubation, free viruses were recovered at concentrations ranging 10(5)-10(10) infectious virus particles per ml of seawater. Using this approach, 15 viruses were isolated and represented 12 unique phage/host systems. Two of the hosts tested were infected by more than one virus. Conclusions: Isolation of high concentrations of specific viruses is possible even if their initial concentrations in native waters are low. This approach allows the recovery of phage/host systems that may not be numerically dominant. Significance and Impact of the Study: This host enrichment protocol for virus detection and isolation is well-suited for aquatic viral ecology studies that require phage/host systems.","aquatic ecosystem; bacteria; lytic; protocol; virus isolation","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2008"

Koi herpesvirus (KHV) disease, a lethal disease in carp and koi, has spread rapidly since the late 1990s. Only a few studies have focused on the ecology of KHV in natural freshwater environments, although characterization and the diagnosis of KHV disease have been intensively studied. This is mainly due to the lack of reliable detection methods for KHV in natural environments. 2. Three different approaches have been used to detect KHV in fish samples: (i) isolation and identification of the virus using cultured cell lines; (ii) detection of viral DNA with target DNA amplification techniques; and (iii) detection of anti-KHV antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among these methods, DNA amplification techniques have become most popular because of their sensitivity and simplicity. 3. In contrast to KHV detection in fish samples, detection of KHV from water and sediment samples has not been reported. This is the result of a lack of reliable KHV concentration methods for water and sediment samples, although methodology from public health and marine microbiology may be applicable to determine KHV concentration in such samples. 4. Few reports have evaluated the environmental factors (e.g. temperature, UV irradiation) that affect the fate of KHV in water bodies. Mass mortality of wild carp caused by KHV infection would result in the removal of a large omnivorous fish from freshwater ecosystems and may thus alter community structure and ecosystem functioning.","common carp; KHV detection; koi; koi herpesvirus","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology","2008"

Members of the family Phycodnaviridae are also interesting due to their extraordinary genome size. Few algal viruses in the Phycodnaviridae family have been sequenced, and those that have been have few genes in common and low gene homology. It has hence been difficult to design general PCR primers that allow further studies of their ecology and diversity. In this study, we screened the nine type I core genes of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses for sequences suitable for designing a general set of primers. Sequence comparison between members of the Phycodnaviridae family, including three partly sequenced viruses infecting the prymnesiophyte Pyramimonas orientalis and the haptophytes Phaeocystis pouchetii and Chrysochromulina ericina (Pyramimonas orientalis virus 01B [PoV-01B], Phaeocystis pouchetii virus 01 [PpV-01], and Chrysochromulina ericina virus 01B [CeV-01B], respectively), revealed eight conserved regions in the major capsid protein (MCP). Two of these regions also showed conservation at the nucleotide level, and this allowed us to design degenerate PCR primers. The primers produced 347- to 518-bp amplicons when applied to lysates from algal viruses kept in culture and from natural viral communities. The aim of this work was to use the MCP as a proxy to infer phylogenetic relationships and genetic diversity among members of the Phycodnaviridae family and to determine the occurrence and diversity of this gene in natural viral communities. The results support the current legitimate genera in the Phycodnaviridae based on alga host species. However, while placing the mimivirus in close proximity to the type species, PBCV-1, of Phycodnaviridae along with the three new viruses assigned to the family (PoV-01B, PpV-01, and CeV-01B), the results also indicate that the coccolithoviruses and phaeoviruses are more diverged from this group. Phylogenetic analysis of amplicons from virus assemblages from Norwegian coastal waters as well as from isolated algal viruses revealed a cluster of viruses infecting members of the prymnesiophyte and prasinophyte alga divisions. Other distinct clusters were also identified, containing amplicons from this study as well as sequences retrieved from the Sargasso Sea metagenome.

Additionally, a survey was conducted on the dynamics of both viruses and bacteria in an isolated floodplain segment of the Danube River and in the main channel near Vienna (Austria) during the hydrologically most dynamic phase (spring - summer). The study evaluates the differences between the main channel and the floodplain segment for suspended particle abundance and quality in relation to bacterial and viral parameters; both free-living forms and those attached to particles are examined. The hydrological disconnection of these two contrasting sampling sites influenced particle abundance and quality as well as the distribution of free-living vs. attached bacteria and viruses. The per-cell activity of bacteria attached to particles was significantly higher than that of the free-living fraction, particularly in the isolated water body. The abundance of bacteria and viruses on particles depended on particle quality (size). In the main channel, bacteria were significantly more abundant on surfaces (per mm(2)) of suspended matter > 5 mu m (aggregates with organic constituents) compared to particles < 5 mu m (mostly mineral grains). In the isolated water body, both bacteria and viruses were more abundant on the larger particles/aggregates. Data from both locations revealed a positive correlation between abundance of particles > 5 mu m and attached viruses; free-living viruses were less abundant at high > 5 mu m particle loads. Only in the isolated floodplain section was viral abundance positively influenced by elevated per-cell productivity of potential host bacteria. The results demonstrate that system variability on a relatively small topographical scale (within a river-floodplain system) has consequences for microbial life, including viruses.","river-floodplain; seston; bacterial activity; virus ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology","2008"

Various physical, chemical and biological factors affect depletion of diatom populations, for which the importance of viruses as a potential mortality source has only recently been found. We isolated and characterized a new Chaetoceros-infecting virus causing the lysis of the cosmopolitan species C. debilis Cleve. The virus infectious for C. debilis was isolated from both water and sediment samples collected in western Japan. We show the physiologic, morphologic and genomic characteristics of one virus clone among many isolates. We first described the C. debilis DNA virus (Cdeb-DNAV), a 30 nm icosahedral virus accumulating in the cytoplasm of C. debilis. Host specificity of CdebDNAV is strain-specific and its infectivity is stably maintained through a wide temperature range (between 20 and -196 degrees C). The latent period and the burst size were estimated to be 12 to 24 h and 55 infectious units per host cell, respectively. CdebDNAV harbors a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome whose structure is unknown. Sequence comparisons showed that the partial sequence of CdebDNAV is highly similar (E value = 10(-56)) to the putative replicase gene of the C. salsugineum nuclear inclusion virus (CsNIV) that harbors a covalently closed circular, partially double-stranded ssDNA genome. This discovery of CdebDNAV may aid in further understanding the ecological dynamics of C. debilis population blooms in nature.","diatom; virus; Chaetoceros; DNA; viral ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; and Microbiology","2008"

Sewage is a major source for contamination of surface water. Data on the presence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in sewage in India are limited. The aim of this study was to look for the presence of HEV RNA in concentrates of sewage specimens collected from a major open sewage drain in Lucknow, India during August 2004 to July 2006, by the polymerase chain reaction, using primers specific for human HEV (genotype 1) or Indian swine HEV (genotype 4). Of the 192 sewage specimens tested, 79 (41%) showed presence of human HEV RNA. The positivity rate was higher during the second year (52/103 [51%]) than during the first year (27/89 [30%]; P=0.005). The seasonal pattern of HEV RNA positivity was as follows: winter months (November to February): 28 of 61 (46%); summer months (March to June): 36 of 66 (55%); and, monsoon months (July to October) 15 of 65 (23%). There was no reported outbreak of hepatitis E in the city during the study period. Swine HEV RNA was not detected in any of the 69 specimens tested. Repeat testing confirmed the reproducibility of the results. In addition, nucleic acid sequencing of six sewage isolates showed that these belonged to HEV genotype 1. The study suggests that HEV infection and fecal viral excretion may be common in HEV-endemic regions throughout the year even during non-epidemic periods.","Hepatitis E virus; HEV; epidemiology; environment; sewage; ecology of and infection","Virology","2007"

Over a 2-year period, we monitored the diversity of two archaeal viruses found in hot springs within Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Both temporal phylogeny and neutral biodiversity models reveal that virus diversity in these local environments is not being maintained by mutation but rather by high rates of immigration from a globally distributed metacommunity. These results indicate that geographically isolated hot springs are readily able to exchange viruses. The importance of virus movement is supported by the detection of virus particles in air samples collected over YNP hot springs and by their detection in metacommunity sequencing projects conducted in the Sargasso Sea. Rapid rates of virus movement are not expected to be unique to these archaeal viruses but rather a common feature among virus metacommunities. The finding that virus immigration rather than mutation can dominate community structure has significant implications for understanding virus circulation and the role that viruses play in ecology and evolution by providing a reservoir of mobile genetic material.","virus dynamics; virus phylogeny; archaeal viruses; sulfolobus and spindle-shaped virus; sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2007"

Along the sewer lines, it was possible to isolate constantly both bacteriophage types (F-RNA and somatic coliphages) at 10(2)-10(4) plaque-forming units (pfu) ml(-1). The average numbers of somatic and F-RNA phages isolated from oxidation pond were 10(3)-10(4) pfu ml(-1); however, somatic coliphages were undetectable for several months (April-August). Significant high correlation (0.944 < R-2 < 0.99) was found between increased anionic detergent concentrations and F-RNA coliphage numbers. Infants less than 1 year old excreted both phage types and few only F-RNA coliphages (at high numbers > 10(5) pfu g(-1)) for up to 1 year. The excretion of F-RNA coliphages was highly linked to Escherichia coli F+ harborage in the intestinal track as found in their faecal content. Finally, three bacterial hosts E. coli F+, F- and CN13 tested for survivability in sewage filtrate revealed that E. coli F+ had the highest survivability under these conditions. Presence of somatic and F male-specific phages in sewer lines of a small community are influenced by several factors such as: anionic detergents, nutrients, temperature, source (mainly infants), shedding and survival capability of the host strain. Better understanding of coliphages ecology in sewer systems can enhance our evaluation of these proposed indicator/index microorganisms used in tracking environmental pollution of water, soil and crop contamination with faecal material containing enteric viruses.",NA,"Microbiology","2007"

The bacterial groups from the gut systems are mainly affiliated to the proteobacteria, the Gram-positive groups Bacterioiodes/Flavobacterium branch and the spirochetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. However, culture independent molecular studies have revealed that the majority of these microbial gut symbionts have not yet been cultured, including actinobacterial clusters associated with termite guts. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to selectively isolate the actinofloral layers of gut associated microflora of the Coptotermes lacteus (Froggatt) species located at the Sunshine Coast Region of Queensland, Australia to increase our knowledge on the diversity of actinobacterial taxa present in the termite guts. Methods and Results: Actinofloral layers associated with the guts of the wood-eating subterranean termite C. lacteus were investigated by exploiting the phage susceptibility of different gut associated bacteria which impede the growth of actinomycetes on isolation plates. These unwanted microbial taxa were removed by exposing the gut contents to polyvalent bacteriophages specifically targeting different background bacterial taxa and after their removal from the isolation plates previously undetected and novel actinomycetes were successfully cultured from the gut samples. Conclusions: Use of bacteriophages as a means of selective pressure successfully revealed the presence of novel actinomycete species within the guts of C. lacteus. Significance and Impact of the Study: Molecular ecology has undoubtedly revealed the fascinating diversity of micro-organisms, which cannot be cultured. However, these advances in the field still have not provided the ability to detect and isolate micro-organisms effectively from their ecological niches. Accordingly, studies like the one described here have importance in increasing the chances of uncultured taxa to be isolated to complement molecular microbial ecological efforts towards the establishment of an understanding on the diversity of termite gut microflora.","actinomycetes; bacteriophage; coptotermes lacteus; rhinotermitid; and selective isolation; subterranean; symbiosis; termite","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2007"

One element in this discussion is the innate viral ""self"" concept, which suggests that viral structures and functions can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of genetic determinants that are inherited from a viral ancestor and encode the viral ""self"". The second group consists of another set of structures and functions, the ""nonself"", which is interchangeable between different viruses and can be obtained via lateral gene transfer. Comparing the structures and sequences of the ""self"" elements, we have proposed that viruses can be grouped into lineages regardless of which domain of life (bacteria, archaea, eukarya) they infect. It has also been suggested that viruses are ancient and possibly predate modern cells. Results: Here we identified thirteen putative prophages (viral genomes integrated into bacterial chromosome) closely related to the virulent icosahedral tailless lipid-containing bacteriophage PM2. Using the comparative genomics approach, we present evidence to support the viral ""self"" hypothesis and divide genes of the bacteriophage PM2 and related prophages into ""self"" and ""nonself"" categories. Conclusion: We show here that the previously proposed most conserved viral ""self"" determinants, the major coat protein and the packaging ATPase, were the only proteins that could be recognized in all detected corticoviral elements. We also argue here that the genes needed for viral genome replication, as well as for host cell lysis, belong to the ""nonself"" category of genes. Furthermore, we suggest that abundance of PM2-like viruses in the aquatic environment as well as their importance in the ecology of aquatic microorganisms might have been underestimated.",NA,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity","2007"

Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the virion showed this to be a Myoviridae, the first reported to infect the genus Halomonas. This temperate phage, Phi gspC, exhibits a broad host range, displaying the ability to infect two different Halomonas spp. also isolated from the GSP. The phage infection process demonstrates a high level of tolerance towards temperature, pH and salinity; however, free virions are rapidly inactivated in water unless supplemented with salt. We show that susceptibility to osmotic shock is correlated with the density of the packaged DNA (rho(pack)). Lysogens of Halomonas salina GSP21 were detrimental to host fitness at 10% salinity, but the lysogen was able to grow faster than the wild type at 20% salinity. From these results we propose that the extensive genome of Phi gspC may encode environmentally relevant genes (ERGs); genes that are perhaps not essential for the phage life cycle but increase host and phage fitness in some environmental conditions.","halophile; bacteriophage ecology; extreme environment; transduction; and viral evolution","Microbiology","2007"

This is particularly true for baculoviruses, a family of large double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the larval stages of insects. Why there should be Such heterogeneity within these Virus Populations is puzzling and what Sustains it is still unknown. It has long been recognized that some baculoviruses have a relatively wide host range, but the effect of different host species on the genotypic structure of a baculovirus population has received little attention. We provide evidence that infection of different insect species can influence the genetic diversity of a Panolis flammea nucleopolyhedrovirus (PaflNPV) Population, isolated from the pine beauty moth. Variable regions of the PaflNPV genome were sequenced and novel ORF's were identified on each of the enlarged fragments. The roles of these orfs and the implications of their presence or absence within different genotypes are discussed. The variable fragments were also labelled with P-32 and used as polymorphic genetic markers of genotype abundance. The proportion of polymorphic loci changed after passage in different insect species and this varied among species, suggesting a role for host selection of pathogen genotypes in the field as a mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity. These results have wide-ranging implications for understanding the ecology of insect-virus interactions in the natural environment and the evolution of baculovirus life history strategies.

Semi-quantitative PCR indicated that some of the isolates were composed of a single dominant genotype, whereas other isolates were composed of two or three genotypes in equal proportions. The coexistence of genotypes could be explained by trade-offs among the three phenotypic traits analyzed, namely pathogenicity (LD50), speed of kill (mean time to death), and OB yields, so that increases in one trait were accompanied by decreases in another. Mixed genotype isolates tended to behave differently to single genotype isolates. Two of the genotypic mixtures were significantly more pathogenic (lower LD50 values) for Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) larvae than the single genotypes that they comprised. OB yield/insect was greater for single genotype compared to mixed genotype isolates, despite genotype-specific differences in mean times to death. Total OB production/insect was positively correlated with time to death. Two out of three of the mixed genotype isolates had lower OB yield/mg insect weight at death compared to single genotype isolates. Each genotypic combination appeared to interact to produce a unique phenotype.

As part of an ongoing study of the microbial ecology of Lake Erie, we have examined the distribution and diversity of viruses in this system. One surprising result has been the pervasive distribution of cyanophages that infect the marine cyanobacterial isolate Synechococcus sp. strain WH7803. Viruses that lytically infect this cyanobacterium were identified throughout the western basin of Lake Erie, as well as in locations within the central and eastern basins. Analyses of the gene encoding the g20 viral capsid assembly protein (a conservative phylogenetic marker for the cyanophage) indicate that these viruses, as well as amplicons from natural populations and the ballast of commercial ships, are related to marine cyanophages but in some cases form a unique clade, leaving questions concerning the native hosts of these viruses. The results suggest that cyanophages may be as important in freshwater systems as they are known to be in marine systems.",NA,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2006"

A previous report documented the high viral abundance in Mono Lake, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of viral DNA from lake water samples showed a diverse population based on a broad range of viral genome sizes. To better understand the ecology of bacteriophages and their hosts in this unique environment, water samples were collected between February 2001 and July 2004 for isolation of bacteriophages by using four indigenous bacterial hosts. Plaque assay results showed a differential seasonal expression of cultured bacteriophages. To reveal the diversity of uncultured bacteriophages, viral DNA from lake water samples was used to construct clone libraries. Sequence analysis of viral clones revealed homology to viral as well as bacterial proteins. Furthermore, dot blot DNA hybridization analyses showed that the uncultured viruses are more prevalent during most seasons, whereas the viral isolates (A phi and phi 2) were less prevalent, confirming the belief that uncultured viruses represent the dominant members of the community, whereas cultured isolates represent the minority species.",NA,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; and Microbiology","2006"

Transmission electron microscopy showed that the virion is composed of an isometric head and a tail complex consisting of a central tube and a contractile sheath with helical symmetry. The morphological features and the host specificity suggest that Ma-LMM01 is a member of the cyanomyovirus group. Using semi-one-step growth experiments, the latent period and burst size were estimated to be 6 to 12 h and 50 to 120 infectious units per cell, respectively. The size of the phage genome was estimated to be ca. 160 kbp using pulse-field gel electrophoresis; the nucleic acid was sensitive to DNase I, Bal31, and all 14 restriction enzymes tested, suggesting that it is a linear double-stranded DNA having a low level of methylation. Phylogenetic analyses based on the deduced amino acid sequences of two open reading frames coding for ribonucleotide reductase alpha- and beta-subunits showed that Ma-LMM01 forms a sister group with marine and freshwater cyanobacteria and is apparently distinct from T4-like phages. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the putative sheath protein showed that Ma-LMM01 does not form a monophyletic group with either the T4-like phages or prophages, suggesting that Ma-LMM01 is distinct from other T4-like phages that have been described despite morphological similarity. The host-phage system which we studied is expected to contribute to our understanding of the ecology of Microcystis blooms and the genetics of cyanophages, and our results suggest the phages could be used to control toxic cyanobacterial blooms.",NA,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology","2006"

However, results indicate that CspNIV remains infectious in surface water of the bay no longer than 1 mo after the disappearance of its host. Thus, our results reinforce the idea that microalgae are also sensitive to viruses other than those belonging to the family Phycodnaviridae.

Ae. aegypti was found in every location sampled, showing higher infestation rates in northern Cameroon. Breeding populations of Ae. albopictus were observed in all 19 southern localities, up to the Adamaoua mountains, but the species was not recorded further north. In the area where both species are present, they were often sampled in the same larval developmental sites, suggesting convergent habitat segregation. The most frequently encountered artificial and natural breeding sites were used tires, discarded tins and plastic containers, abandoned car parts, brick holes, dead leaves on the ground, tree holes, and rock pools. Further monitoring of the demographic as well as geographic expansion of Ae. albopictus in this Afrotropical environment and its relationships with indigenous Ae. aegypti should provide insight into the biology of this highly invasive species and help to implement arboviruses surveillance programs in the area.","Aedes aegypti; Aedes albopictus; larval ecology; Cameroon; Africa","Entomology; Veterinary Sciences","2005"

However, most of these marine phages are uncharacterized because few of their hosts have been cultivated. To learn more about such phages, we designed a set of degenerate PCR primers for phage T4 g23, which encodes the major capsid protein in all of the T4-type phages, an important family of the tailed phage. These primers were used to amplify g23-related sequences from diverse marine environments (fjords and bays of British Columbia, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the western Arctic Ocean) revealing a remarkable level of molecular diversity, which in some cases was correlated with morphological variation of the virions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that although some of these sequences were closely related to well studied subgroups of the T4-type phage, such as the T-evens, the majority of them belong to five previously uncharacterized subgroups. These data indicate that the host range of T4-type phages is much broader than previously imagined and that the laboratory isolate T4 belongs to a phage family that is extraordinarily widespread and diverse in the biosphere.","diversity; T4-type phage; gene 23; genomics; ecology","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2005"

The virus particle is icosahedral, lacks a tail, and is ca. 25 nm in diameter. SssRNAV formed crystalline arrays and random assemblies within the cytoplasm of host cells, and it was also concentrated along the intracellular membrane structures. By means of one-step growth experiments, the lytic cycle and the burst size were estimated to be <8 h and 5.8 X 10(3) to 6.4 x 10(4) infectious units per host cell, respectively.

The first male sterility gene was found in the wild rice, and introduced to the cultivated rice, which launched the fast development of the high-yielding hybrid rice. Other agronomically beneficial traits in the wild rice, such as rice tungro virus resistance, bacterial leaf blight (Xa21 gene) resistance and acid sulfate soil tolerance, have played important roles in rice breeding. China has the northernmost distribution area of wild rice possessing great genetic diversity. However, most of the populations of this species have disappeared in China over the last three decades, mainly caused by habitat loss, fragmentation and other human disturbances. Unfortunately, the decline of existing populations still continues. In the present study, we reviewed studies on genetic diversity and conservation of this wild rice in China, concentrating on population structure, pollen competition, pollen/gene flow from cultivated rice to wild rice, and ecological restoration in relation to in situ conservation. The relatively high genetic diversity of populations of O. rufipogon in China suggests that there is great value for conservation. Considerable gene flow from cultivated rice to wild rice may alter the genetic structure of natural populations of O. rufipogon and eventually lead to its genetic erosion. Pollen competition between wild and cultivated rice has caused a low rate of crop-to-wild gene flow, but it does not completely prevent gene flow from the crop. Effective isolation measures should be undertaken in the regions where in situ conservation of O. rufipogon is carried out. Reintroduction is an important alternative for the in situ conservation of wild rice species. As wild rice is an important genetic resource, both in situ and ex situ conservation strategies are needed.","common wild rice; conservation; gene flow; genetic diversity; genetic and resource; Oryza rufipogon; restoration","Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","2005"

Comparative nucleotide and protein sequence analysis indicates that these phages are a remarkable source of untapped genetic diversity, encoding 2,170 predicted protein-encoding ORFs, of which 1,402 cannot be annotated for structure or function, and 522 are proteins with no similarity to other phage or bacterial sequences. Based on their genome size, organization of their gene map and comparative nucleotide and protein sequence analysis, the S. aureus phages can be organized into three groups. Comparison of their gene maps reveals extensive genome mosaicism, hinting to a large reservoir of unidentified S. aureus phage genes. Among the phages in the largest size class (178-214 kbp) that we characterized is phage Twort, the first discovered bacteriophage (responsible for the Twort-D'Herelle effect).

We present here a 3-year analysis of the population dynamics of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in Central Spain in weed hosts and melon. CMV infection in weed hosts was detected throughout the year and showed a clear seasonality, with maximum incidence of 20 to 30% in summer and autumn. The dynamics of CMV incidence were different in various weed habitats (i.e., fallow fields, edges, and wastelands), which differed in stability due to the degree of human intervention. CMV incidence in weed habitats was correlated with the amount of vegetation, estimated both as biomass and as soil cover by plants. CMV population dynamics in melon crops was unrelated to that in weed habitats. Genetic characterization by ribonuclease protection assays and biological characterization on differential hosts showed no significant differences in the frequency of genotypes or biotypes for CMV isolates from weeds or melon. Hence, different population dynamics in various hosts and habitats has not resulted in population differentiation, suggesting that migration between hosts and habitats prevents fragmentation of the population.","virus ecology","Plant Sciences","2004"

Highlight-adapted Prochlorococcus hosts yielded Podoviridae exclusively, which were extremely host-specific, whereas low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus and all strains of Synechococcus yielded primarily Myoviridae, which has a broad host range. Finally, both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus strain-specific cyanophage titres were low (< 10(3) ml(-1)) in stratified oligotrophic waters even where total cyanobacterial abundances were high (> 10(5) cells ml(-1)).

We examined the sensitivity of 291 host strains to 25 phages by streaking slants of the presumptive host strain onto an agar layer that contains bacteriophages, which gives a total of 7275 combinations (sensitivity tests). Only a 3.02% of the tests showed sensitivity. Additionally, six environmental strains were used as hosts to count phages in sewage and seawater. Phages isolated on these strains were used to infect strain WG5. The environmental strains detected 1 log(10) fewer phages than strain WG5 in sewage and seawater. The fraction of phages that were detected by the six strains and that also infected strain WG5 ranged from < 0.07% to < 2.0% of the total amount of bacteriophages detected by strain WG5 in the same samples.

Of these isolates, 23 (92%) comprised between 44 and 96% 481-G revertants by MAPREC. The other two isolates had revertant percentages close to the 0.6% of the attenuated reference strain. It was presumed that these 23 isolates would be variant with potential neurovirulence by MAPREC analysis. Of the 23 isolates, three were isolated from river water. Moreover, our results by MAPREC showed that type 2 poliovirus was phenotypically more variable than type 1 (69%) or type 3 (55%), as determined in previous studies. The prevalence of virulent-type VDPVs in river and sewage water suggested that the oral poliovaccine itself had led to wide environmental pollution in nature.

Maps displaying the probabilities of occurrence of mating types and genotypes of P. infestans, and of disease severity at a regional scale, were presented. Some genotypes that exhibited differences in epidemiologically important features such as metalaxyl sensitivity and aggressiveness to tomato and potato had a restricted spread and were localized in isolated areas. Analysis of late blight severity showed recurring patterns, such as the earliest onset of the disease in the area where both potato and tomato were growing, strengthening the hypothesis that infected potato tubers are the main source of primary inoculum.
