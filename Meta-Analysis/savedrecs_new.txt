AB Insect vectors transmit viruses and bacteria that can cause severe diseases in plants and economic losses due to a decrease in crop production. Insect vectors, like all other organisms, are colonized by a community of various microorganisms, which can influence their physiology, ecology, evolution, and also their competence as vectors. The important ecological meaning of bacteriophages in various ecosystems and their role in microbial communities has emerged in the past decade. However, only a few phages have been described so far in insect microbiomes. The leafhopper Euscelidius variegatus is a laboratory vector of the phytoplasma causing Flavescence doree, a severe grapevine disease that threatens viticulture in Europe. Here, the presence of a temperate bacteriophage in E. variegatus (named Euscelidius variegatus phage 1, EVP-1) was revealed through both insect transcriptome analyses and electron microscopic observations. The bacterial host was isolated in axenic culture and identified as the bacterial endosymbiont of E. variegatus (BEV), recently assigned to the genus Candidatus Symbiopectobacterium. BEV harbors multiple prophages that become active in culture, suggesting that different environments can trigger different mechanisms, finely regulating the interactions among phages. Understanding the complex relationships within insect vector microbiomes may help in revealing possible microbe influences on pathogen transmission, and it is a crucial step toward innovative sustainable strategies for disease management in agriculture.

AB Genetic reassortment of influenza A viruses through cross-species transmission contributes to the generation of pandemic influenza viruses. To provide information on the ecology of influenza viruses, we have been conducting a global surveillance of zoonotic influenza and establishing an influenza virus library. Of 4580 influenza virus strains in the library, 3891 have been isolated from over 70 different bird species. The remaining 689 strains were isolated from humans, pigs, horses, seal, whale, and the environment. Phylogenetic analyses of the HA genes of the library isolates demonstrate that the library strains are distributed to all major known clusters of the H1, H2 and H3 subtypes of HA genes that are prevalent in humans. Since past pandemic influenza viruses are most likely genetic reassortants of zoonotic and seasonal influenza viruses, a vast collection of influenza A virus strains from various hosts should be useful for vaccine preparation and diagnosis for future pandemics.

AB Aims Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are ecologically important group of anaerobic micro-organisms that can reduce sulphate to form hydrogen sulphide-a toxic gas causing iron corrosion on metal surfaces. In this work, SRB strains were isolated from aquatic environments in the country of Georgia to determine their lysogenicity and the role of temperate phages in host metabolism.
   Methods and Results SRB strains were isolated in samples from the Black Sea coast of Georgia. Based on their genetic, cytological and physiological properties of bacteria, 10 Georgian isolates were assigned to the genus Desulfovibrio. Temperate bacteriophages were induced from three out of ten strains by UV-exposure. Comparison of metal (Fe and Cr) reduction and utilization of various carbon sources by the wild-type (lysogenic) bacterial strains and their UV-irradiated counterparts was done.
   Conclusions Temperate phage in the cells of SRB could alter significant functions of bacteria and may have a contribution in the acquisition of different traits by SRB.
   Significance and Impact of the Study This article pointed to a significant role for temperate bacteriophages in the metabolism and metabolic potential of host strains of SRB, which were first isolated from the aquatic environment of Georgia.

AB Increasing sequence information indicates that RNA viruses constitute a major fraction of marine virus assemblages. However, only 12 RNA virus species have been described, infecting known host species of marine single-celled eukaryotes. Eight of these use diatoms as hosts, while four are resident in dinoflagellate, raphidophyte, thraustochytrid, or prasinophyte species. Most of these belong to the order Picornavirales, while two are divergent and fall into the families Alvernaviridae and Reoviridae. However, a very recent study has suggested that there is extraordinary diversity in aquatic RNA viromes, describing thousands of viruses, many of which likely use protist hosts. Thus, RNA viruses are expected to play a major ecological role for marine unicellular eukaryotic hosts. In this review, we describe in detail what has to date been discovered concerning viruses with RNA genomes that infect aquatic unicellular eukaryotes.

   'black box'
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY

DT Review
DE virome; metagenome; metaviromics; phage; aquatic; viral ecology;
   cultivation
AB Viruses are found in almost all biomes on Earth, with bacteriophages (phages) accounting for the majority of viral particles in most ecosystems. Phages have been isolated from natural environments using the plaque assay and liquid medium-based dilution culturing. However, phage cultivation is restricted by the current limitations in the number of culturable bacterial strains. Unlike prokaryotes, which possess universally conserved 16S rRNA genes, phages lack universal marker genes for viral taxonomy, thus restricting cultureindependent analyses of viral diversity. To circumvent these limitations, shotgun viral metagenome sequencing (i.e., metaviromics) has been developed to enable the extensive sequencing of a variety of viral particles present in the environment and is now widely used. Using metaviromics, numerous studies on viral communities have been conducted in oceans, lakes, rivers, and soils, resulting in many novel phage sequences. Furthermore, auxiliary metabolic genes such as ammonic monooxygenase C and beta-lactamase have been discovered in viral contigs assembled from viral metagenomes. Current attempts to identify putative bacterial hosts of viral metagenome sequences based on sequence homology have been limited due to viral sequence variations. Therefore, culture-independent approaches have been developed to predict bacterial hosts using single-cell genomics and fluorescentlabeling. This review focuses on recent viral metagenome studies conducted in natural environments, especially in aquatic ecosystems, and their contributions to phage ecology. Here, we concluded that although metaviromics is a key tool for the study of viral ecology, this approach must be supplemented with phage-host identification, which in turn requires the cultivation of phage-bacteria systems.

AB During summer 2014, three hypersaline brines were discovered in two frozen lakes of Boulder Clay (Northern Victoria Valley, Antarctica). Ongoing research seeks to gain novel insights on the microbial ecology of such environments, in order to further the understanding of life adaptation to extreme conditions. To this aim, the abundance of prokaryotic cells (including cell morphologies and size for biomass conversion), the amount of viable cells (in terms of membrane-intact cells and respiring cells), the viral count, the physiological profiles at community level and the main microbial enzymatic activities were described. The brines differed each other in terms of prokaryotic cells' abundance, size, and viability as well as viral abundance. Cell morphotypes and metabolic responses also varied among the brine samples. Underground interconnections were likely to occur, with the microbial community becoming more abundant and structured to better exploit the limited resource availability. Overall, complex interactions among multiple environmental factors, including marine water origin, depth horizon, isolation time of the brines, and climatic variations, reflected on the microbial community distribution patterns and highlighted the need to preserve these niches of extreme life.

SO NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Using epicPCR, a method that fuses a phage marker gene with the 16S rRNA gene of infected bacterial cells at single-cell resolution, the authors identify host-virus interactions and dynamics over time in an estuarine environment.
   Viruses impact microbial diversity, gene flow and function through virus-host interactions. Although metagenomics surveys are rapidly cataloguing viral diversity, methods are needed to capture specific virus-host interactions in situ. Here, we leveraged metagenomics and repurposed emulsion paired isolation-concatenation PCR (epicPCR) to investigate viral diversity and virus-host interactions in situ over time in an estuarine environment. The method fuses a phage marker, the ribonucleotide reductase gene, with the host 16S rRNA gene of infected bacterial cells within emulsion droplets providing single-cell resolution for dozens of samples. EpicPCR captured in situ virus-host interactions for viral clades with no closely related database representatives. Abundant freshwater Actinobacteria lineages, in particular Rhodoluna sp., were the most common hosts for these poorly characterized viruses, with interactions correlated with environmental factors. Multiple methods used to identify virus-host interactions, including epicPCR, identified different and largely non-overlapping interactions within the vast virus-host interaction space. Tracking virus-host interaction dynamics also revealed that multi-host viruses had significantly longer periods with observed virus-host interactions, whereas single-host viruses were observed interacting with hosts at lower minimum abundances, suggesting more efficient interactions. Capturing in situ interactions with epicPCR revealed environmental and ecological factors shaping virus-host interactions, highlighting epicPCR as a valuable technique in viral ecology.

AB Indigenous peoples in Brazil have suffered disproportionately from the COVID-19 pandemic due to limited access to an already precarious public health system together with continued attacks on their cultures, their territories and their way of life. These attacks come as part of the government's attempts to further neoliberal development and undermine environmental and indigenous rights, taking advantage of what the Minister of Environment called 'a moment of calm while the press is focusing on the pandemic'. The pandemic has intensified environmental conflicts affecting indigenous peoples, both in amplifying conflicts but also in sparking new acts of resistance and self-protection of indigenous lives and territories. Based on case studies and monitoring of rapidly evolving social media and WhatsApp posts, we analyse these processes through a political ecology lens. We find confirmed cases and deaths amongst indigenous peoples centred around tourism hotspots, mining sites, and other development projects. Yet the presence of these risks, and long term conflicts related to land-grabbing and resource theft linked to said development, has in some cases strengthened community ties and increased capacity for active resistance. While some Mebengokre (Kayapo) communities in the Amazon have fled further into the forest to maintain isolation, others have expelled gold-miners from their villages. Tupinamba and Pataxo communities in the Northeast have set up blockades to keep people, and the virus, out. The retomadas, or reclaiming of land, of the Tupinamba, Pataxo and Pataxo-Halfahai in Bahia State, are a case in point: the long-term struggle to reclaim their lands has strengthened community ties and capacity for active resistance. The recent road blockades of the Mebengokre (Kayapo) incorporated demands for COVID-19 support into a long history of demands for compensation for the negative impacts suffered from mining and road construction in their territories. At the national level, indigenous movements, which have grown in strength and number in the fight against Bolsonaro's 'politics of extermination' and through engagement of a new cohort of indigenous youth who had access to higher education, were able to draw on social media and indigenous led court cases to help counteract the 'genocide by omission' that has been worsened by the pandemic.

TI A Novel Group of Promiscuous Podophages Infecting Diverse
   Gammaproteobacteria from River Communities Exhibits Dynamic Intergenus
   Host Adaptation

LA English
DT Article
DE bacteriophages; environmental microbiology; experimental evolution;
   microbial ecology; phage-bacterium interactions
AB Phages are generally described as species specific or even strain specific, implying an inherent limitation for some to be maintained and spread in diverse bacterial communities. Moreover, phage isolation and host range determination rarely consider the phage ecological context, likely biasing our notion on phage specificity. Here we isolated and characterized a novel group of six promiscuous phages, named Atoyac, existing in rivers and sewage by using a diverse collection of over 600 bacteria retrieved from the same environments as potential hosts. These podophages isolated from different regions in Mexico display a remarkably broad host range, infecting bacteria from six genera: Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Yersinia, Hafnia, Escherichia, and Serratia. Atoyac phage genomes are similar to 42 kb long and highly similar to each other, but not to those currently available in genome and metagenome public databases. Detailed comparison of the phages' efficiency of plating (EOP) revealed variation among bacterial genera, implying a cost associated with infection of distant hosts, and between phages, despite their sequence similarity. We show, through experimental evolution in single or alternate hosts of different genera, that efficiency of plaque production is highly dynamic and tends toward optimization in hosts rendering low plaque formation. However, adaptation to distinct hosts differed between similar phages; whereas one phage optimized its EOP in all tested hosts, the other reduced plaque production in one host, suggesting that propagation in multiple bacteria may be key to maintain promiscuity in some viruses. Our study expands our knowledge of the virosphere and uncovers bacteriumphage interactions overlooked in natural systems.
   IMPORTANCE In natural environments, phages coexist and interact with a broad variety of bacteria, posing a conundrum for narrow-host-range phage maintenance in diverse communities. This context is rarely considered in the study of host-phage interactions, typically focused on narrow-host-range viruses and their infectivity in target bacteria isolated from sources distinct to where the phages were retrieved from. By studying phage-host interactions in bacteria and viruses isolated from river microbial communities, we show that novel phages with promiscuous host range encompassing multiple bacterial genera can be found in the environment. Assessment of hundreds of interactions in diverse hosts revealed that similar phages exhibit different infection efficiency and adaptation patterns. Understanding host range is fundamental in our knowledge of bacterium-phage interactions and their impact on microbial communities. The dynamic nature of phage promiscuity revealed in our study has implications in different aspects of phage research such as horizontal gene transfer or phage therapy.

AB Major studies of the Black Sea algal viruses in Russia have been conducted at scientific institutes located in the city of Sevastopol. A review of the methodological approaches used during 2002-2019 shows that both classical virological methods and methods that were recently developed and patented (among them those by the authors) are applicable to the search for, isolation, and study of algal viruses. The study of samples of clinical material and material of aquatic organisms, as well as model experiments, including those using a unique laboratory apparatus and a test stand, revealed new data on the biology and ecology of marine viruses. Based on the results from these studies, it was proposed to use algal viruses monitoring as a component in aquatic environment monitoring, in which algal viruses are considered as biological indicators and/or markers.

AB The genomics era has revolutionized studies of adaptive evolution by monitoring large numbers of loci throughout the genomes of many individuals. Ideally, the investigation of emergence in plant viruses requires examining the population dynamics of both virus and host, their interactions with each other, with other organisms and the abiotic environment. Genetic mechanisms that affect demographic processes are now being studied with high-throughput technologies, traditional genetics methods, and new computational tools for big-data. In this review, we discuss the utility of these approaches to monitor and detect changes in virus populations within cells and individuals, and over wider areas across species and communities of ecosystems. The advent of genomics in virology has fostered a multidisciplinary approach to tackling disease risk The ability to make sense of the information now generated in this integrated setting is by far the most substantial obstacle to the ultimate goal of plant virology to minimize the threats to food security posed by disease. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to understand and forecast how populations respond to future changes in complex natural systems.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the ecology of the common arboviral mosquito vectors in Mombasa, Kilifi and Malindi urban areas of coastal Kenya. Mosquito larvae were collected using standard dippers and pipettes. Egg survivorship in dry soil was evaluated by collecting soil samples from dry potential larval developmental sites, re-hydrating them for hatching and rearing of the eventual larvae to adults. Adult mosquitoes were collected with CDC light traps and BG-Sentinel traps. All blood-fed females were tested for bloodmeal origin. Mosquitoes were screened for arboviruses using RT-qPCR. Overall, the predominant species were Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) 72.4% (n = 2,364) and Aedes aegypti (L.), 25.7%, (n = 838). A total of 415 larval developmental sites were identified indoors (n = 317) and outdoors (n = 98). The most productive larval developmental sites, both indoors and outdoors, were assorted small containers, water tanks, drainages, drums, and jerricans. Overall, 62% (n = 18) of the soil samples collected were positive for larvae which were used as a proxy to measure the presence of eggs. The mosquitoes fed on humans (29.8%) and chickens (3.7%). Of 259 mosquitoes tested for viral infection, 11.6% were positive for Flavivirus only. The most productive larval developmental sites for arboviral vectors indoors were small containers, water tanks, jerricans, and drums whereas small containers, water tanks, drainage channels, buckets, tires, and water troughs were the productive larval developmental sites outdoors.

AB Viral nervous necrosis (VNN), caused by nervous necrosis virus (NNV), is a worldwide disease that severely imperils many kinds of marine and freshwater fish. In this study, a NNV strain CNPgg2018 isolated from pearl gentian grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus male x Epinephelus fuscoguttatu female) juveniles was identified and characterized by histopathology examination, transmission electron microscopic (TEM), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus culture, phylogenetic analysis and experimental infection. The results showed that the diseased fish exhibited symptoms with loss of appetite, darkened body and abnormal swimming behavior. Histopathological examination revealed widespread diffuse vacuolation degeneration appeared in the brain, retina and peripheral nerve tissues. TEM observation showed that numerous virions with a diameter of about 25 nm scattered around the retinal vacuolation. Significant cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed in striped snakehead (SSN-1) and grouper brain (GB) cell lines, not in Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE-214), epithelioma papillosum cyprini (EPC) and fat-head minnow (FHM) cell lines after inoculation of pathological tissue homogenates. RT-PCR and phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that CNPgg2018 was a member of NNV with highly homology to RGNNV genotype. Besides, both monomer and tripolymer forms of capsid protein were detected through structural polypeptide analysis and three-dimensional model prediction. Infection experiment demonstrated that CNPgg2018 was virulent to pearl gentian grouper juvenile with a LD50 of 1.0 x 10(6.1) TCID50/fish. In conclusion, we investigated a natural disease in pearl gentian grouper and confirmed that the pathogen was NNV. The results of this study provide new insights into the current research on the biology, ecology and host range of NNV.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic and its global response have resulted in unprecedented and rapid changes to most people's day-to-day lives. To slow the spread of the virus, governments have implemented the practice of physical distancing ("social distancing"), which includes isolation within the home with limited time spent outdoors. During this extraordinary time, nature around the home may play a key role in mitigating against adverse mental health outcomes due to the pandemic and the measures taken to address it. To assess whether this is the case, we conducted an online questionnaire survey (n = 3,000) in Tokyo, Japan, to quantify the association between five mental health outcomes (depression, life satisfaction, subjective happiness, self-esteem, and loneliness) and two measures of nature experiences (frequency of greenspace use and green view through windows from home). Accounting for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, we found that the frequency of greenspace use and the existence of green window views from within the home was associated with increased levels of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness and decreased levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Our findings suggest that a regular dose of nature can contribute to the improvement of a wide range of mental health outcomes. With the recent escalation in the prevalence of mental health disorders, and the possible negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health, our findings have major implications for policy, suggesting that urban nature has great potential to be used as a "nature-based solution" for improved public health.

AB Bacteriophages have immense potential as antibiotic therapies and in genetic engineering. Understanding the mechanisms that bacteriophages implement to infect their hosts will allow researchers to manipulate these systems and adapt them to specific bacterial targets. In this study, we isolated a bacteriophage capable of infecting the marine alphaproteobacterium Phaeobacter inhibens and determined its mechanism of infection. Phaeobacter virus MD18, a novel species of bacteriophage isolated in Woods Hole, MA, exhibits potent lytic ability against P. inhibens and appears to be of the Siphoviridae morphotype. The genomic sequence of MD18 displayed significant similarity to another siphophage, the recently discovered Roseobacter phage DSS3P8, but genomic and phylogenetic analyses, assessing host range and a search of available metagenomes are all consistent with the conclusion that Phaeobacter phage MD18 is a novel lytic phage. We incubated MD18 with a library of barcoded P. inhibens transposon insertion mutants and identified 22 genes that appear to be required for phage predation of this host. Network analysis of these genes using genomic position, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment, and protein associations revealed that these genes are enriched for roles in assembly of a type IV pilus (T4P) and regulators of cellular morphology. Our results suggest that T4P serve as receptors for a novel marine virus that targets P. inhibens.
   IMPORTANCE Bacteriophages are useful nonantibiotic therapeutics for bacterial infections as well as threats to industries utilizing bacterial agents. This study identified Phaeobacter virus MD18, a phage antagonist of Phaeobacter inhibens, a bacterium with promising use as a probiotic for aquatic farming industries. Genomic analysis suggested that Phaeobacter phage MD18 has evolved to enhance its replication in P. inhibens by adopting favorable tRNA genes as well as through genomic sequence adaptation to resemble host codon usage. Lastly, a high-throughput analysis of P. inhibens transposon insertion mutants identified genes that modulate host susceptibility to phage MD18 and implicated the type IV pilus as the likely receptor recognized for adsorption. This study marks the first characterization of the relationship between P. inhibens and an environmentally sampled phage, which informs our understanding of natural threats to the bacterium and may promote the development of novel phage technologies for genetic manipulation of this host.

AB Multi-omics approaches, including metagenomics and single-cell amplified genomics, have revolutionized our understanding of the hidden diversity and function of microbes in nature. Even in the omics age, cultivation is an essential discipline in microbial ecology since microbial cultures are necessary to assess the validity of an in silico prediction about the microbial metabolism and to isolate viruses infecting bacteria and archaea. However, the ecophysiological characteristics of predominant freshwater bacterial lineages remain largely unknown due to the scarcity of cultured representatives. In an ongoing effort to cultivate the uncultured majority of freshwater bacteria, the most abundant freshwater Actinobacteria acI clade has recently been cultivated from Lake Soyang through catalase-supplemented high-throughput cultivation based on dilution-to-extinction. This method involves physical isolation of target microbes from mixed populations, culture media simulating natural habitats, and removal of toxic compounds. In this protocol, we describe detailed procedures for isolating freshwater oligotrophic microbes, as well as the essence of the dilution-to-extinction culturing. As a case study employing the catalase-supplemented dilution-to-extinction protocol, we also report a cultivation trial using a water sample collected from Lake Soyang. Of the 480 cultivation wells inoculated with a single lake-water sample, 75 new acI strains belonging to 8 acI tribes (acI-A1, A2, A4, A5, A6, A7, B1, B4, C1, and C2) were cultivated, and each representative strain per subclade could be revived from glycerol stocks. These cultivation results demonstrate that the protocol described in this study is efficient in isolating freshwater bacterioplankton harboring streamlined genomes.

   EXTRACTION
AB Determining exact viral titers in a given sample is essential for many environmental and clinical applications, e.g., for studying viral ecology or application of bacteriophages for food safety. However, virus quantification is not a simple task, especially for complex environmental samples. While clonal viral isolates can be quantified with relative high accuracy using virus-specific methods, i.e., plaque assay or quantitative real-time PCR, these methods are not valid for complex and diverse environmental samples. Moreover, it is not yet known how precisely laser-based methods, i.e., epifluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and nanoparticle tracking analysis, quantify environmental viruses. In the present study, we compared five state-of-the-art viral quantification methods by enumerating four model viral isolates of different genome and size characteristics as well as four different environmental water samples. Although Nanoparticle tracking analysis combined with gentle staining at 30 degrees C could be confirmed by this study to be a reliable quantification technique for tested environmental samples, environmental samples still lack an universally applicable and accurate quantification method. Special attention has to be put on optimal sample concentrations as well as optimized sample preparations, which are specific for each method. As our results show the inefficiency when enumerating small, or single-stranded DNA or RNA viruses, the global population of viruses is presumably higher than expected.

AB Background The western flower thrips,Frankliniella occidentalis(Pergande), is a globally invasive pest and plant virus vector on a wide array of food, fiber, and ornamental crops. The underlying genetic mechanisms of the processes governing thrips pest and vector biology, feeding behaviors, ecology, and insecticide resistance are largely unknown. To address this gap, we present theF. occidentalisdraft genome assembly and official gene set.
   Results We report on the first genome sequence for any member of the insect order Thysanoptera. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog (BUSCO) assessments of the genome assembly (size = 415.8 Mb, scaffold N50 = 948.9 kb) revealed a relatively complete and well-annotated assembly in comparison to other insect genomes. The genome is unusually GC-rich (50%) compared to other insect genomes to date. The official gene set (OGS v1.0) contains 16,859 genes, of which similar to 10% were manually verified and corrected by our consortium. We focused on manual annotation, phylogenetic, and expression evidence analyses for gene sets centered on primary themes in the life histories and activities of plant-colonizing insects. Highlights include the following: (1) divergent clades and large expansions in genes associated with environmental sensing (chemosensory receptors) and detoxification (CYP4, CYP6, and CCE enzymes) of substances encountered in agricultural environments; (2) a comprehensive set of salivary gland genes supported by enriched expression; (3) apparent absence of members of the IMD innate immune defense pathway; and (4) developmental- and sex-specific expression analyses of genes associated with progression from larvae to adulthood through neometaboly, a distinct form of maturation differing from either incomplete or complete metamorphosis in the Insecta.
   Conclusions Analysis of theF. occidentalisgenome offers insights into the polyphagous behavior of this insect pest that finds, colonizes, and survives on a widely diverse array of plants. The genomic resources presented here enable a more complete analysis of insect evolution and biology, providing a missing taxon for contemporary insect genomics-based analyses. Our study also offers a genomic benchmark for molecular and evolutionary investigations of other Thysanoptera species.

AB A prerequisite to improve the predictability of microbial community dynamics is to understand the mechanisms of microbial assembly. To study factors that contribute to microbial community assembly, we examined the temporal dynamics of genes in five aquatic metagenome time-series, originating from marine offshore or coastal sites and one lake. With this trait-based approach we expected to find gene-specific patterns of temporal allele variability that depended on the seasonal metacommunity size of carrier-taxa and the variability of the milieu and the substrates to which the resulting proteins were exposed. In more detail, we hypothesized that a larger seasonal metacommunity size would result in increased temporal variability of functional units (i.e., gene alleles), as shown previously for taxonomic units. We further hypothesized that multicopy genes would feature higher temporal variability than single-copy genes, as gene multiplication can result from high variability in substrate quality and quantity. Finally, we hypothesized that direct exposure of proteins to the extracellular environment would result in increased temporal variability of the respective gene compared to intracellular proteins that are less exposed to environmental fluctuations. The first two hypotheses were confirmed in all data sets, while significant effects of the subcellular location of gene products was only seen in three of the five time-series. The gene with the highest allele variability throughout all data sets was an iron transporter, also representing a target for phage infection. Previous work has emphasized the role of phage-prokaryote interactions as a major driver of microbial diversity. Our finding therefore points to a potentially important role of iron transporter-mediated phage infections for the assembly and maintenance of diversity in aquatic prokaryotes.

AB Blooms of cyanobacteria cause enormous losses in both the economy and environment. Cyanophages are of great potential for fighting blooming cyanobacteria. Research report on cyanophage of bloom-forming cyanobacterium,Microcystis elabensis deficient. vB_MelS-Me-ZS1 (abbreviated as Me-ZS1) was isolated from fresh water by double-layer agar plate method usingM. elabens. TEM exhibited that cyanosiphovirus Me-ZS1 has an icosahedral head about 60 nm in diameter, and a noncontractile tail approximately 260 nm. Experimental infection against 15 cyanobacterial strains showed that Me-ZS1 can infect 12 strains across taxonomic orders (Chroococcales, Nostocales and Oscillatoriales). High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis revealed that Me-ZS1 has a double-stranded DNA genome of 49,665 bp, with a G + C content of 58.22%, and 73 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). BLASTn and ORF comparisons showed that Me-ZS1 shares very low homology with the public sequences, and the phylogenetic tree based on TerL indicated that Me-ZS1 may delegate a novel and genetically distinct clade of Siphoviridae phages. In microcosm experiment, Me-ZS1 represented apparent effect on reducing relative abundance of cyanobacteria, increasing relative abundance of Saprospiraceae and protecting brocade carp (Carassius auratus) in cyanobacterial bloom water. This study isolated and characterized a novel broad-host-rangeMicrocystisphage Me-ZS1 presenting a genetically distinct clade of freshwater cyanophage. The features of cyanophage Me-ZS1 provide a potential solution to the loss caused by cyanobacterial bloom.

AB Viruses are extremely diverse and not all of this diversity has been captured so far. In this Review, Martinez Martinez, Martinez-Hernandez and Martinez-Garcia explore the potential and limitations of single-virus genomics and how this emerging technology can complement other methods.
   Viruses are extremely diverse and modulate important biological and ecological processes globally. However, much of viral diversity remains uncultured and yet to be discovered. Several powerful culture-independent tools, in particular metagenomics, have substantially advanced virus discovery. Among those tools is single-virus genomics, which yields sequenced reference genomes from individual sorted virus particles without the need for cultivation. This new method complements virus culturing and metagenomic approaches and its advantages include targeted investigation of specific virus groups and investigation of genomic microdiversity within viral populations. In this Review, we provide a brief history of single-virus genomics, outline how this emergent method has facilitated advances in virus ecology and discuss its current limitations and future potential. Finally, we address how this method may synergistically intersect with other single-virus and single-cell approaches.

AB Congregation of different migratory and resident bird species on aquatic ecosystems during winter migration increases contact rates and enhances influenza A virus (IAV) transmission. However, scarce research has been focused on the resident bird's contribution to the viral ecology at a local scale. The Mexican duck (Anas diazi) is an endemic endangered anatid from Mexico. This resident species shares aquatic habitats with migratory birds in the wetlands of Central Mexico. Therefore, here we describe the phylogenetic analysis of an IAV (A/Mexican duck/EstadodeMexico; Lerma/UIFMVZ377/2016(H5N2)) isolated in this species, during spatiotemporal concurrence with migratory anatids in the winter season. All eight gene sequences were obtained by nextgeneration sequencing. Maximum Likelihood trees were constructed using MEGA-X, with General Time Reversible + Invariant (GTR+I), Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) heuristic method, and 1000 bootstrap replicates. Similarities with six different IAV subtypes were observed through a BLAST search: H6N5, H7N7, H5N2, H4N6, H9N2, and H11N9, detected in wild ducks during 2015 in the Pacific, Central and Mississippi flyways stop sites across the United States of America and Canada. The molecular identification of this reassortant H5N2 IAV highlights the importance of resident species as a reservoir host and its potential participation in the maintenance and transmission of IAV in wetlands surrounded by rural areas.

AB The predominant model of the role of viruses in the marine trophic web is that of the "viral shunt," where viral infection funnels a substantial fraction of the microbial primary and secondary production back to the pool of dissolved organic matter. Here, we analyzed the composition of non-eukaryotic DNA associated with individual cells of small, planktonic protists in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) and the Mediterranean Sea. We found viral DNA associated with a substantial fraction cells from the GoM (51%) and the Mediterranean Sea (35%). While Mediterranean SAGs contained a larger proportion of cells containing bacterial sequences (49%), a smaller fraction of cells contained bacterial sequences in the GoM (19%). In GoM cells, nearly identical bacteriophage and ssDNA virus sequences where found across diverse lineages of protists, suggesting many of these viruses are non-infective. The fraction of cells containing viral DNA varied among protistan lineages and reached 100% in Picozoa and Choanozoa. These two groups also contained significantly higher numbers of viral sequences than other identified taxa. We consider mechanisms that may explain the presence of viral DNA in protistan cells and conclude that protistan predation on free viral particles contributed to the observed patterns. These findings confirm prior experiments with protistan isolates and indicate that the viral shunt is complemented by a viral link in the marine microbial food web. This link may constitute a sink of viral particles in the ocean and has implications for the flow of carbon through the microbial food web.

AB Simple Summary
   There is a lack of knowledge about the impact that phages present in the environment may have against certain Salmonella serovars. Thus, an improved understanding of Salmonella phage diversity will provide a better insight into the role of phages in Salmonella ecology and diversity. The results of this study showed that the poultry farm environment could represent a valuable source of Salmonella phages, which are more varied in broiler than in layer farms.
   The exploration of novel nonantibiotic interventions in the field, such as the use of bacteriophages, is necessary to avoid the presence of Salmonella. Bacteriophages are a group of viruses widely distributed in nature, strictly associated with the prokaryotic cell. Researchers have demonstrated the success of phage therapy in reducing Salmonella counts in poultry products. However, the impact that phage concentration in the environment may have against certain Salmonella serovars is not well understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess Salmonella phage prevalence in commercial poultry farms in terms of the production type: layers or broilers. The most prevalent Salmonella serovars isolated in poultry production were used for phage isolation. Salmonella specific phages were isolated from 141 layer and broiler farms located in the Valencia region during 2019. Analysis of the samples revealed that 100% presented Salmonella phages, the most prevalent being against serovar S. Enteritidis (93%), followed by S. Virchow (59%), S. Typhimurium (55%), S. Infantis (52%) and S. Ohio (51%). These results indicate that poultry farms could represent an important source of Salmonella phages. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to assess the epidemiology of phages against other serovars present in other countries and their diversity from the point of view of molecular studies.

AB Phages drive bacterial diversity, profoundly influencing microbial communities, from microbiomes to the drivers of global biogeochemical cycling. Aiming to broaden our understanding ofEscherichia coli(MG1655, K-12) phages, we screened 188 Danish wastewater samples and isolated 136 phages. Ninety-two of these have genomic sequences with less than 95% similarity to known phages, while most map to existing genera several represent novel lineages. The isolated phages are highly diverse, estimated to represent roughly one-third of the true diversity of culturable virulent dsDNAEscherichiaphages in Danish wastewater, yet almost half (40%) are not represented in metagenomic databases, emphasising the importance of isolating phages to uncover diversity. Seven viral families,Myoviridae,Siphoviridae,Podoviridae, Drexlerviridae, Chaseviridae, Autographviridae,andMicroviridae,are represented in the dataset. Their genomes vary drastically in length from 5.3 kb to 170.8 kb, with a guanine and cytosine (GC) content ranging from 35.3% to 60.0%. Hence, even for a model host bacterium, substantial diversity remains to be uncovered. These results expand and underline the range of coliphage diversity and demonstrate how far we are from fully disclosing phage diversity and ecology.

AB Cultivated bacterioplankton representatives from diverse lineages and locations are essential for microbiology, but the large majority of taxa either remain uncultivated or lack isolates from diverse geographic locales. We paired large-scale dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation with microbial community analysis and modeling to expand the phylogenetic and geographic diversity of cultivated bacterioplankton and to evaluate DTE cultivation success. Here, we report results from 17 DTE experiments totaling 7,820 individual incubations over 3 years, yielding 328 repeatably transferable isolates. Comparison of isolates to microbial community data for source waters indicated that we successfully isolated 5% of the observed bacterioplankton community throughout the study; 43% and 26% of our isolates matched operational taxonomic units and amplicon single-nucleotide variants, respectively, within the top 50 most abundant taxa. Isolates included those from previously uncultivated clades such as SAR 1 LD12 and Actinobacteria aclV, as well as geographically novel members from other ecologically important groups like SAR11 subclade IIla, SAR116, and others, providing isolates in eight putatively new genera and seven putatively new species. Using a newly developed DTE cultivation model, we evaluated taxon viability by comparing relative abundance with cultivation success. The model (i) revealed the minimum attempts required for successful isolation of taxa amenable to growth on our media and (ii) identified possible subpopulation viability variation in abundant taxa such as SAR11 that likely impacts cultivation success. By incorporating viability in experimental design, we can now statistically constrain the effort necessary for successful cultivation of specific taxa on a defined medium.
   IMPORTANCE Even before the coining of the term "great plate count anomaly" in the 1980s, scientists had noted the discrepancy between the number of microorganisms observed under the microscope and the number of colonies that grew on traditional agar media. New cultivation approaches have reduced this disparity, resulting in the isolation of some of the "most wanted" bacterial lineages. Nevertheless, the vast majority of microorganisms remain uncultured, hampering progress toward answering fundamental biological questions about many important microorganisms. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated the underlying factors influencing cultivation success, limiting our ability to improve cultivation efficacy. Our work details the use of dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation to expand the phylogenetic and geographic diversity of available axenic cultures. We also provide a new model of the DTE approach that uses cultivation results and natural abundance information to predict taxon-specific viability and iteratively constrain DTE experimental design to improve cultivation success.

AB A drop of seawater contains numerous microspatial niches at the scale relevant to microbial activities. Examples are abiotic niches such as detrital particles that show different sizes and organic contents, and biotic niches resulting from bacteria-phage and bacteria-phytoplankton interactions. A common practice to investigate the impact of microenvironments on bacterial evolution is to separate the microenvironments physically and compare the bacterial inhabitants from each. It remains poorly understood, however, which microenvironment primarily drives bacterioplankton evolution in the pelagic ocean. By applying a dilution cultivation approach to an undisturbed coastal water sample, we isolate a bacterial population affiliated with the globally dominantRoseobactergroup. Although varying at just a few thousand nucleotide sites across the whole genomes, members of this clonal population are diverging into two genetically separated subspecies. Genes underlying speciation are not unique to subspecies but instead clustered at the shared regions that represent similar to 6% of the genomic DNA. They are primarily involved in vitamin synthesis, motility, oxidative defense, carbohydrate, and amino acid utilization, consistent with the known strategies that roseobacters take to interact with phytoplankton and particles. Physiological assays corroborate that one subspecies outcompetes the other in these traits. Our results indicate that the microenvironments in the pelagic ocean represented by phytoplankton and organic particles are likely important niches that drive the cryptic speciation of the Roseobacter population, though microhabitats contributed by other less abundant pelagic hosts cannot be ruled out.

AB Since the first discovery of diatom viruses, more than a dozen species have been identified, and these viruses can significantly affect the dynamics of diatoms in nature. To better understand marine primary productivity, details of the relationship between viruses and their diatom hosts must be elucidated. The marine diatomChaetoceros debilisis a cosmopolitan species and its blooms are often observed in highly productive areas. To date, onlyC. debilisDNA virus (CdebDNAV) has been isolated and characterized. In this study, we successfully identified a previously unknown virus-like particle (VLP) and ssDNA molecules co-occurring with CdebDNAV. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the cytoplasm of infectedC. debilisrevealed particles that were 21 and 36 nm in size, corresponding to the newly identified VLPs and CdebDNAV, respectively. The ssDNA molecules encode a putative capsid protein (CP); however, no proteins related to replication were detected. The estimated molecular weight of the CP is 24.4 kDa, similar to that of VLPs in the protein electrophoresis analysis. Genetic analyses revealed that the CP shows low levels of similarity with uncultured marine ssDNA viruses, but seems to be independent of the known virus genera. Although the relationships between the smaller VLP and ssDNA molecules identified in this study were not fully revealed, it might be a new virus. The finding is important for understanding diatom virus ecology and to promote further characterization of uncultured aquatic ssDNA viruses.

AB Vibrio choleraenon-O1, non-O139 bacteria are natural inhabitants of aquatic ecosystems and have been sporadically associated with human infections. They mostly lack the two major virulence factors of toxigenicV. choleraeserogroups O1 and O139 strains, which are the causative agent of cholera. Non-O1, non-O139 strains are found in water bodies, sediments, and in association with other aquatic organisms. Occurrence of these bacteria in fecal specimens of waterfowl were reported, and migratory birds likely contribute to the long-distance transfer of strains. We investigated fourV. choleraenon-O1, non-O139 isolates for phenotypic traits and by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The isolates were recovered from organs of domestic ducks with serious disease symptoms. WGS data revealed only a distant genetic relationship between all isolates. The isolates harbored a number of virulence factors found in mostV. choleraestrains. Specific virulence factors of non-O1, non-O139 strains, such as the type III secretion system (TTSS) or cholix toxin, were observed. An interesting observation is that all isolates possess multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin toxins (MARTX) closely related to the MARTX of toxigenic El Tor O1 strains. Different primary sequences of the abundant OmpU proteins could indicate a significant role of this virulence factor. Phenotypic characteristics such as hemolysis and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were studied. Three isolates showed susceptibility to a number of tested antimicrobials, and one strain possessed AMR genes located in an integron. Knowledge of the environmental occurrence ofV. choleraenon-O1, non-O139 in Germany is limited. The source of the infection of the ducks is currently unknown. In the context of the 'One Health' concept, it is desirable to study the ecology ofV. choleraenon-O1, non-O139, as it cannot be excluded that the isolates possess zoonotic potential and could cause infections in humans.

TI First Isolation of a Novel Aquatic Flavivirus from Chinook Salmon

AB The first isolation of a flavivirus from fish was made from moribund Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the Eel River, California, USA. Following the observation of cytopathic effect in a striped-snakehead fish cell line, 35-nm virions with flaviviral morphology were visualized using electron microcopy. Next-generation sequencing and rapid amplification of cDNA ends obtained the complete genome. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed the presence of viral RNA in formalin-fixed tissues from the wild salmon. For the first time, in vivo replication of an aquatic flavivirus was demonstrated following intracoelomic injection in a Chinook salmon model of infection. RT-qPCR demonstrated viral replication in salmon brains up to 15 days postinjection. Infectious virus was then reisolated in culture, fulfilling Rivers' postulates. Only limited replication occurred in the kidneys of Chinook salmon or in tissues of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The proposed salmon flavivirus (SFV) has a 10.3-kb genome that encodes a rare dual open reading frame, a feature uncharacteristic of classical flaviviruses. Phylogenetic analysis places SFV in a basal position among a new subgroup of recently recognized aquatic and bat flaviviruses distinct from the established mosquito-borne, tick-borne, insect-only, and unknown-vector flavivirus groups. While the pathogenic potential of the virus remains to be fully elucidated, its basal phylogeny and the in vivo infection model will allow SFV to serve as a prototype for aquatic flaviviruses. Ongoing field and laboratory studies will facilitate better understanding of the potential impacts of SFV infection on ecologically and economically important salmonid species.
   IMPORTANCE Chinook salmon are a keystone fish species of great ecological and commercial significance in their native northern Pacific range and in regions to which they have been introduced. Threats to salmon populations include habitat degradation, climate change, and infectious agents, including viruses. While the first isolation of a flavivirus from wild migrating salmon may indicate an emerging disease threat, characterization of the genome provides insights into the ecology and long evolutionary history of this important group of viruses affecting humans and other animals and into an expanding group of recently discovered aquatic flaviviruses.

AB Although bacteriophages are central entities in bacterial ecology and population dynamics, there is currently no literature on the genomes of bacteriophages isolated from groundwater. Using a collection of bacterial isolates from an aquifer as hosts, this study isolated, sequenced and characterised two bacteriophages native to the groundwater reservoir. Host phylogenetic analyses revealed that the phages targeted B. mycoides and a novel Pseudomonas species. These results suggest that both bacteriophages represent new genera, highlighting that groundwater reservoirs, and probably other subsurface environments as well, are underexplored biotopes in terms of the presence and ecology of bacteriophages.

AB Background
   Permafrost, frozen ground cemented with ice, occupies about a quarter of the Earth's hard surface and reaches up to 1000 metres depth. Due to constant subzero temperatures, permafrost represents a unique record of past epochs, whenever it comes to accumulated methane, oxygen isotope ratio or stored mummies of animals. Permafrost is also a unique environment where cryptobiotic stages of different microorganisms are trapped and stored alive for up to hundreds of thousands of years. Several protist strains and two giant protist viruses isolated from permafrost cores have been already described.
   New information
   In this paper, we describe a collection of 35 amoeboid protist strains isolated from the samples of Holocene and Pleistocene permanently frozen sediments. These samples are stored at -18 degrees C in the Soil Cryology Lab, Pushchino, Russia and may be used for further studies and isolation attempts. The collection strains are maintained in liquid media and may be available upon request. The paper also presents a dataset which consists of a table describing the samples and their properties (termed "Sampling events") and a table describing the isolated strains (termed "Occurrences"). The dataset is publicly available through the GBIF portal.

AB Author summary This study describes the development of a set of interchangeable diagnostic assays for the detection of Ebola virus in patient samples. Each are rapid-turnaround, highly-specific (showing no detection of non-Ebola strains), sensitive and portable. These assays are ideally placed for field-use during outbreaks in low-resource countries and equally suited to use as conventional high-throughput laboratory tests. They encompass a colourimetric option with easy-to-interpret pink-to-yellow colour-change visualisation and real-time detection formats allowing the approximation of virus copy number, which helps monitoring of virus levels during infection. The inclusion of a probe-based detection method also leaves the door open for multi-pathogen detection, which could be useful for future VHF outbreaks, where the cause is unknown.
   Background The unprecedented 2013/16 outbreak ofZaire ebolavirus(Ebola virus) in West Africa has highighted the need for rapid, high-throughput and POC diagnostic assays to enable timely detection and appropriate triaging of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) patients. Ebola virus is highly infectious and prompt diagnosis and triage is crucial in preventing further spread within community and healthcare settings. Moreover, due to the ecology of Ebola virus it is important that newly developed diagnostic assays are suitable for use in both the healthcare environment and low resource rural locations. Methodology/Principle findings A LAMP assay was successfully developed with three detection formats; a real-time intercalating dye-based assay, a real-time probe-based assay to enable multiplexing and an end-point colourimetric assay to simplify interpretation for the field. All assay formats were sensitive and specific, detecting a range of Ebola virus strains isolated in 1976-2014; with Probit analysis predicting limits of detection of 243, 290 and 75 copies/reaction respectively and no cross-detection of related strains or other viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF's). The assays are rapid, (as fast as 5-7.25 mins for real-time formats) and robust, detecting Ebola virus RNA in presence of minimally diluted bodily fluids. Moreover, when tested on patient samples from the 2013/16 outbreak, there were no false positives and 93-96% of all new case positives were detected, with only a failure to detect very low copy number samples. Conclusion/Significance These are a set of robust and adaptable diagnostic solutions, which are fast, easy-to-perform-and-interpret and are suitable for use on a range of platforms including portable low-power devices. They can be readily transferred to field-laboratory settings, with no specific equipment needs and are therefore ideally placed for use in locations with limited resources.

TI Critical medical ecology and SARS-COV-2 in the urban environment: a
   pragmatic, dynamic approach to explaining and planning for research and
   practice
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Background Practitioners and researchers in the midst of overwhelming coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks are calling for new ways of looking at such pandemics, with an emphasis on human behavior and holistic considerations. Viral outbreaks are characterized by socio-behaviorally-oriented public health efforts aimed at reducing exposure and prevention of morbidity/mortality once infected. These efforts involve different points-of-view, generally, than do those aimed to understand the virus' natural history. Rampant spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cities clearly signals that urban areas contain conditions favorable for rapid transmission of the virus. Main text The Critical Medical Ecology model is a multidimensional, multilevel way of viewing pandemics comprehensively, rooted simultaneously in microbiology and in anthropology, with shared priority for evolution, context, stressors, homeostasis, adaptation, and power relationships. Viewing COVID-19 with a Critical Medical Ecological lens suggests three important interpretations: 1) COVID-19 is equally - if not more - a socially-driven disease as much as a biomedical disease, 2) the present interventions available for primary prevention of transmission are social and behavioral interventions, and 3) wide variation in COVID-19 hospitalization/death rates is not expected to significantly be attributable to a more virulent and rapidly-evolving virus, but rather to differences in social and behavioral factors - and power dynamics - rather than (solely) biological and clinical factors. Cities especially are challenged due to logistics and volume of patients, and lack of access to sustaining products and services for many residents living in isolation. Conclusions In the end, SARS-CoV-2 is acting upon dynamic social human beings, entangled within structures and relationships that include but extend far beyond their cells, and in fact beyond their own individual behavior. As a comprehensive way of thinking, the Critical Medical Ecology model helps identify these elements and dynamics in the context of ecological processes that create, shape, and sustain people in their multidimensional, intersecting environments.

AB Comparative analyses have played a key role in understanding how gene regulatory evolution contributes to primate phenotypic diversity. Recently, these studies have expanded to include a wider range of species, within-population as well as interspecific analyses, and research on wild as well as captive individuals. This expansion provides context for understanding genetic and environmental effects on gene regulation in humans, including the importance of the pathogen and social environments. Although taxonomic representation remains biased, inclusion of more species has also begun to reveal the evolutionary processes that explain whether and when gene regulation is conserved. Together, this work highlights how studies in other primates contribute to understanding evolution in our own lineage, and we conclude by identifying promising avenues for future work.

AB The study of soil viruses, though not new, has languished relative to the study of marine viruses. This is particularly due to challenges associated with separating virions from harboring soils. Generally, three approaches to analyzing soil viruses have been employed: (1) Isolation, to characterize virus genotypes and phenotypes, the primary method used prior to the start of the 21st century. (2) Metagenomics, which has revealed a vast diversity of viruses while also allowing insights into viral community ecology, although with limitations due to DNA from cellular organisms obscuring viral DNA. (3) Viromics (targeted metagenomics of virus-like-particles), which has provided a more focused development of 'virus-sequence-to-ecology' pipelines, a result of separation of presumptive virions from cellular organisms prior to DNA extraction. This separation permits greater sequencing emphasis on virus DNA and thereby more targeted molecular and ecological characterization of viruses. Employing viromics to characterize soil systems presents new challenges, however. Ones that only recently are being addressed. Here we provide a guide to implementing these three approaches to studying environmental viruses, highlighting benefits, difficulties, and potential contamination, all toward fostering greater focus on viruses in the study of soil ecology.

AB Bacillus anthracisis a soil-borne, Gram-positive endospore-forming bacterium and the causative agent of anthrax. It is enzootic in Pafuri, Kruger National Park in South Africa. The bacterium is amplified in a wild ungulate host, which then becomes a source of infection to the next host upon its death. The exact mechanisms involving the onset (index case) and termination of an outbreak are poorly understood, in part due to a paucity of information about the soil-based component of the bacterium's lifecycle. In this study, we present the unique isolation of a dsDNA bacteriophage from a wildebeest carcass site suspected of having succumbed to anthrax. The aggressively lytic bacteriophage hampered the initial isolation ofB. anthracisfrom samples collected at the carcass site. Classic bacteriologic methods were used to test the isolated phage onB. anthracisunder different conditions to simulate deteriorating carcass conditions. Whole genome sequencing was employed to determine the relationship between the bacterium isolated on site and the bacteriophage-dubbedBacillusphage Crookii. The 154,012 bp phage belongs toMyoviridaeand groups closely with another African anthrax carcass-associatedBacillusphage WPh.Bacillusphage Crookii was lytic againstB. cereus sensu latogroup members but demonstrated a greater affinity for encapsulatedB. anthracisat lower concentrations (<1 x 10(8)pfu) of bacteriophage. The unusual isolation of this bacteriophage demonstrates the phage's role in decreasing the inoculum in the environment and impact on the life cycle ofB. anthracisat a carcass site.

AB Alaska represents a globally important region for the ecology of avian-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) given the expansive wetlands in this region, which serve as habitat for numerous hosts of IAVs that disperse among four continents during the annual cycle. Extensive sampling of wild birds for IAVs in Alaska since 1991 has greatly extended inference regarding intercontinental viral exchange between North America and East Asia and the importance of Beringian endemic species to IAV ecology within this region. Data on IAVs in aquatic birds inhabiting Alaska have also been useful for helping to establish global patterns of prevalence in wild birds and viral dispersal across the landscape. In this review, we summarize the main findings from investigations of IAVs in wild birds and wetlands of Alaska with the aim of providing readers with an understanding of viral ecology within this region. More specifically, we review viral detections, evidence of IAV exposure, and genetic characterization of isolates derived from wild bird samples collected in Alaska by host taxonomy. Additionally, we provide a short overview of wetland complexes within Alaska that may be important to IAV ecology at the continental scale.

AB The discovery in 1976 of waterfowl as the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs) has since spurred decades of waterfowl surveillance efforts by researchers dedicated to understanding the ecology of IAV and its subsequent threat to human and animal health. Here, we employed a multidecade, continental-scale approach of surveillance data to understand trends of seasonal IAV subtype diversity. Between 1976 and 2015, IAVs were detected in 8,427 (10.8%) of 77,969 samples from migratory waterfowl throughout the Central and Mississippi Migratory Flyways in the United States and Canada. A total of 96 hemagglutinin (HA)/neuraminidase (NA) subtype combinations were isolated, which included most HA (H1 to H14) and all 9 NA subtypes. We observed an annual trend of high influenza prevalence, involving a few dominant subtypes, on northern breeding grounds during summer with progressively lowered influenza prevalence, comprised of a highly diverse profile of subtypes, as waterfowl migrate toward southern wintering grounds. Isolates recovered during winter had the highest proportion of mixed and rare HA/NA combinations, indicating increased opportunity for reassortment of IAVs. In addition, 70% of H5 and 49% of H7 IAV isolates were recovered from samples collected during fall and spring, respectively; these are subtypes that can have significant implications for public health and agriculture sectors. Annual cyclical dominance of subtypes on northern breeding grounds is revealed through the longitudinal nature of this study. Our novel findings exhibit the unrealized potential for discovery using existing IAV surveillance data.
   IMPORTANCE Wild aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs) and are therefore responsible for the dispersal and maintenance of IAVs representing a broad range of antigenic and genetic diversity. The aims of IAV surveillance in waterfowl not only relate to understanding the risk of spillover risk to humans, but also to improving our understanding of basic questions related to IAV evolution and ecology. By evaluating several decades of surveillance data from wild aquatic birds sampled along North American migratory flyways, we discovered an annual trend of increasing subtype diversity during southbound migration, peaking on southern wintering grounds. Winter sampling revealed the highest proportion of mixed and rare infections that suggest higher opportunity for spillover. These findings allow improvements to surveillance efforts to robustly capture IAV diversity that will be used for vaccine development and cultivate a more thorough understanding of IAV evolution and persistence mechanisms.

ID INFORMATION; BACTERIA; GENOMES
AB Giant viruses have large genomes, often within the size range of cellular organisms. This distinguishes them from most other viruses and demands additional effort for the successful recovery of their genomes from environmental sequence data. Here, we tested the performance of genome-resolved metagenomics on a recently isolated giant virus, Fadolivirus, by spiking it into an environmental sample from which two other giant viruses were isolated. At high spike-in levels, metagenome assembly and binning led to the successful genomic recovery of Fadolivirus from the sample. A complementary survey of the major capsid protein indicated the presence of other giant viruses in the sample matrix but did not detect the two isolated from this sample. Our results indicate that genome-resolved metagenomics is a valid approach for the recovery of near-complete giant virus genomes given that sufficient clonal particles are present. However, our data also underline that a vast majority of giant viruses remain currently undetected, even in an era of terabase-scale metagenomics.
   IMPORTANCE The discovery of large and giant nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) with genomes in the megabase range and equipped with a wide variety of features typically associated with cellular organisms was one of the most unexpected, intriguing, and spectacular breakthroughs in virology. Recent studies suggest that these viruses are highly abundant in the oceans, freshwater, and soil, impact the biology and ecology of their eukaryotic hosts, and ultimately affect global nutrient cycles. Genome-resolved metagenomics is becoming an increasingly popular tool to assess the diversity and coding potential of giant viruses, but this approach is currently lacking validation.

AB As the most abundant biological entities, viruses are major players in marine ecosystems. However, our knowledge about virus-host interactions and viral ecology in the deep sea remains very limited. In this study, a novel bacteriophage (designated as phage BVE2) infecting Bacillus cereus group bacteria, was isolated from deep-sea sediments. Phage BVE2 caused host lysis within 1.5 h after infection. However, the presence of two integrase-encoding genes in the BVE2 genome suggested that BVE2 may also follow a temperate strategy. The genome of phage BVE2 is approximately 20 kb in length and is predicted to encode 28 proteins. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis suggested that BVE2 is a highly mosaic phage that has inherited genetic features from Wbeta-like viruses, B. cereus prophages, and its host, suggesting that frequent horizontal gene transfer events occurred during its evolution. This study will help to reveal the evolutionary history of Wbeta-like viruses and improve our understanding of viral diversity and virus-host interactions in the deep sea.

AB Infectious agents are key components of animal ecology and drivers of host population dynamics. Knowledge of their diversity and transmission in the wild is necessary for the management and conservation of host species like Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Although pathogen exchange can occur throughout the salmon life cycle, evidence is lacking to support transmission during population mixing at sea or between farmed and wild salmon due to aquaculture exposure. We tested these hypotheses using a molecular approach that identified infectious agents and transmission potential among sub-adult Atlantic salmon at marine feeding areas and adults in three eastern Canadian rivers with varying aquaculture influence. We used high-throughput qPCR to quantify infection profiles and next generation sequencing to measure genomic variation among viral isolates. We identified 14 agents, including five not yet described as occurring in Eastern Canada. Phylogenetic analysis of piscine orthoreovirus showed homology between isolates from European and North American origin fish at sea, supporting the hypothesis of intercontinental transmission. We found no evidence to support aquaculture influence on wild adult infections, which varied relative to environmental conditions, life stage, and host origin. Our findings identify research opportunities regarding pathogen transmission and biological significance for wild Atlantic salmon populations.

AB Background Bacteriophages (phages) are the most numerous biological entities on Earth and play a crucial role in shaping microbial communities. Investigating the bacteriophage community from soil will shed light not only on the yet largely unknown phage diversity, but may also result in novel insights towards their functioning in the global biogeochemical nutrient cycle and their significance in earthbound ecosystems. Unfortunately, information about soil viromes is rather scarce compared to aquatic environments, due to the heterogeneous soil matrix, which rises major technical difficulties in the extraction process. Resolving these technical challenges and establishing a standardized extraction protocol is, therefore, a fundamental prerequisite for replicable results and comparative virome studies. Results We here report the optimization of protocols for the extraction of phage DNA from agricultural soil preceding metagenomic analysis such that the protocol can equally be harnessed for phage isolation. As an optimization strategy, soil samples were spiked with Listeria phage A511 (Myovirus), Staphylococcus phage 2638A Delta LCR (Siphovirus) and Escherichia phage T7 (Podovirus) (each 10(6) PFU/g soil). The efficacy of phage (i) elution, (ii) filtration, (iii) concentration and (iv) DNA extraction methods was tested. Successful extraction routes were selected based on spiked phage recovery and low bacterial 16S rRNA gene contaminants. Natural agricultural soil viromes were then extracted with the optimized methods and shotgun sequenced. Our approach yielded sufficient amounts of inhibitor-free viral DNA for shotgun sequencing devoid of amplification prior library preparation, and low 16S rRNA gene contamination levels (<= 0.2 parts per thousand). Compared to previously published protocols, the number of bacterial read contamination was decreased by 65%. In addition, 379 novel putative complete soil phage genomes (<= 235 kb) were obtained from over 13,000 manually identified viral contigs, promising the discovery of a large, previously inaccessible viral diversity. Conclusion We have shown a considerably enhanced extraction of the soil phage community by protocol optimization that has proven robust in both culture-dependent as well as through viromic analyses. Our huge data set of manually curated soil viral contigs substantially increases the amount of currently available soil virome data, and provides insights into the yet largely undescribed soil viral sequence space.

AB Coquillettidia linealis (Skuse, 1889) is a common mosquito species, widespread in south-east Australia. It is associated with permanent freshwater habitats where it can be very abundant and the cause of significant nuisance biting. Additionally, Cq. linealis is thought to be a significant vector of some arboviruses, such as Ross River virus, because numerous isolates have been recovered from the species. Although recognition of the species in 1889 was based on adult females, the larval stage has never been described. This lack of description has been primarily because the larvae are cryptic; all larval stages have modified respiratory siphons that pierce and remain attached to subsurface tissues of aquatic plants, from which they gain oxygen. Similarly, pupae have modified respiratory trumpets to attach to plants below the water surface. In this study, adult host-seeking females were field collected and blood fed for oviposition, and the resulting larvae were reared to adults to establish a sustainable colony, from which fourth-instar larvae were selected to provide the first formal description of this life stage of Cq. linealis. This description allows differentiation of Cq. linealis from larvae of its local congener Coquillettidia xanthogaster (Edwards) as well as local Mansonia species but not the larvae of the other Coquillettidia species in Australia that are still undescribed.

AB The aims of this work are to isolate bacterial symbionts from nudibranchs and subsequently to determine anti-Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA cytotoxicity and anti-Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) activities of bio compounds. A total of 15 species of nudibranchs were collected from Karimunjawa and five species from Bali, respectively. A total of 245 bacteria isolates were obtained. The anti-MRSA activity screening activity indicated two active bacteria. Ethyl acetate extracts from supernatants, indicating extracelullar compounds, showed an inhibition zone against MRSA at concentrations of 500-1,000 mu g/ml. DNA sequence analysis showed that the strain KJB-07 from Phyllidia coelestis was closely related to Pseudoalteromonas rubra, whereas the strain NP31-01 isolated from Phyllidia varicosa was closely related to Virgibacillus salarius. The extract of Pseudoalteromonas rubra was cytotoxic to Vero cells at a concentration of 75 mu g/ml. The extract of V. salarius presented no cytotoxicity at concentrations of 5-1,000 mu g/ml. No anti HSV-1 was observed for both isolated bacteria. This is the first study describing research on anti-MRSA, cytotoxicity and anti HSV-1 activity of bacterial symbionts from the viscera of nudibranch. Compounds produced by Pseudoalteromonas rubra and V. salarius, had potential anti-MRSA activity. However, only extracts from Pseudoalteromonas rubra showed cytotoxic effects on Vero cells. Three compounds were identified by LC/MS after purification from culture supernatant.

AB Numerous bacteriophages-viruses of bacteria, also known as phages-have been described for hundreds of bacterial species. The Gram-negative Shigella species are close relatives of Escherichia coli, yet relatively few previously described phages appear to exclusively infect this genus. Recent efforts to isolate Shigella phages have indicated these viruses are surprisingly abundant in the environment and have distinct genomic and structural properties. In addition, at least one model system used for experimental evolution studies has revealed a unique mechanism for developing faster infection cycles. Differences between these bacteriophages and other well-described model systems may mirror differences between their hosts' ecology and defense mechanisms. In this review, we discuss the history of Shigella phages and recent developments in their isolation and characterization and the structural information available for three model systems, Sf6, Sf14, and HRP29; we also provide an overview of potential selective pressures guiding both Shigella phage and host evolution.

AB Double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses of the family Lavidaviridae, commonly known as virophages, are a fascinating group of eukaryotic viruses that depend on a coinfecting giant dsDNA virus of the Mimiviridae for their propagation. Instead of replicating in the nucleus, virophages multiply in the cytoplasmic virion factory of a coinfecting giant virus inside a phototrophic or heterotrophic protistal host cell. Virophages are parasites of giant viruses and can inhibit their replication, which may lead to increased survival rates of the infected host cell population. The genomes of virophages are 17-33 kilobase pairs (kbp) long and encode 16-34 proteins. Genetic signatures of virophages can be found in metagenomic datasets from various saltwater and freshwater environments around the planet. Most virophages share a set of conserved genes that code for a major and a minor capsid protein, a cysteine protease, a genome-packaging ATPase, and a superfamily 3 helicase, although the genomes are otherwise diverse and variable. Lavidaviruses share genes with other mobile genetic elements, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer and recombination have been major forces in shaping these viral genomes. Integrases are occasionally found in virophage genomes and enable these DNA viruses to persist as provirophages in the chromosomes of their viral and cellular hosts. As we watch the genetic diversity of this new viral family unfold through metagenomics, additional isolates are still lacking and critical questions regarding their infection cycle, host range, and ecology remain to be answered.

DT Article
DE Food chain; Pandemic; Eating habits
AB The pandemic generated by the virus known as Covid-19 is an expression of an unbalanced relationship between man and environment on which geography is called to investigate and also to redefine the spaces of intervention. It will be useful to propose the adoption of a trasncalar point of view that, if in one way widens the horizon to the entire globe in a contagion and in a need for collaboration that do not recognize nor can allow us to raise limits, on the other hand, it becomes a metaphor and a warning to create a new ecology and new social political relations to weave as much at a global level as at a local and personal level.
   From the forced isolation - due to the rules of social distancing adopted in many European and non - European states - paradoxically emerged a glocal dialectic to interpret. As can be seen from observing what is happening in the Italian agri-food sector, on one hand we are forced to open our economic spaces recognizing the indispensable contribution of immigrant labour for the cultivation and harvest in the fields. On the other hand we are led to close the horizon of our primary needs without being able to address the question to our trusted provider and/or topographically closer even through the network that puts us in contact with the entire rural world. The authors, also thanks to the results of the direct survey, conducted on the purchases and the alimentary habits of the families during the pandemic, underline the opportunities of growth and valorisation of the Italian agricultural and food sector.

AB Microbial biofilms are ubiquitous in drinking water systems, yet our understanding of drinking water biofilms lags behind our understanding of those in other environments. Here, a six-member model bacterial community was used to identify the interactions and individual contributions of each species to community biofilm formation. These bacteria were isolated from the International Space Station potable water system and include Cupriavidus metallidurans, Chryseobacterium gleum, Raistonia insidiosa, Ralstonia pickettii, Methylorubrum (Methylobacterium) populi and Sphingomonas paucimobilis, but all six species are common members of terrestrial potable water systems. Using reconstituted assemblages, from pairs to all 6 members, community biofilm formation was observed to be robust to the absence of any single species and only removal of the C. gleum/S. paucimobilis pair, out of all 15 possible 2-species subtractions, led to loss of community biofilm formation. In conjunction with these findings, dual-species biofilm formation assays supported the view that the contribution of C. gleum to community biofilm formation was dependent on synergistic biofilm formation with either R. insidiosa or C. metallidurans. These data support a model of multiple, partially redundant species interactions to generate robustness in biofilm formation. A bacteriophage and multiple predatory bacteria were used to test the resilience of the community to the removal of individual members in situ, but the combination of precise and substantial depletion of a single target species was not achievable. We propose that this assemblage can be used as a tractable model to understand the molecular bases of the interactions described here and to decipher other functions of drinking water biofilms.

AB Live bird markets (LBMs) in Korea have been recognized as a reservoir, amplifier, and source of avian influenza viruses (AIVs); however, little was known about the role of LBMs in the epidemiology of AIVs in Korea until recently. Through 10 years of surveillance (2006-2016) we have isolated and sequenced H9N2 viruses in Korean LBMs. To understand how H9N2 evolves and spreads in Korea, a statistical Bayesian phylogenetic model was used. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that three separate introductions of progenitor gene pools, Korean domestic duck-origin and two wild aquatic bird-origin AIVs, contributed to the generation of the five genotypes of H9N2 viruses in Korea. Phylogenetic reconstruction of ecological states infer that the LBMs are where chickens become infected with the virus, with domestic ducks playing a major role in the transmission and evolution of the H9N2 viruses. Three increases in the genetic diversity of H9N2 viruses were observed and coincided with transitions in host species and the locations (domestic farm, LBM, slaughterhouse, and wild aquatic bird habitat) where the viruses were isolated, accompanying genetic reassortment. Following the introduction of a wild aquatic bird-origin AIVs in 2008, six genes of the Korean lineage H9N2 virus were replaced with genes originating from wild aquatic birds, and viruses with this new genotype became predominant in Korean LBMs.

AB The cyanobacteria constitute a diverse group of prokaryotic organisms widespread in aquatic ecosystems. Microcystis is a genus of freshwater cyanobacteria, which poses a possible cause for concern due to its excessive growth and potential for toxin production, which can be aggravated by intensive eutrophication of freshwaters and climate changes. Factors that can potentially affect the biology, ecology and evolution of cyanobacteria are cyanophages. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding cyanophages specific to Microcystis sp. in the natural environment of East Asia and Central Europe. Being a group of planktonic viruses, cyanophages have been studied since the 1960s; information on viruses specific to Microcystis sp. was first obtained in the 1970s and are being dynamically developing over the last two decades. There are eight strains of cyanophages capable of lysing Microcystis sp. cells reported to date, belonging to Myoviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae families, as well as forming Corticovirus-like particles. Available literature data indicates that the gene encoding the sheath protein of the contractile tail (g91) is a good molecular marker for tracing Microcystis viruses from Myoviridae as a form of environmental analysis. It has been suggested that in natural ecosystems, this group of cyanophages can cause a shift in the host population from predominant 'cyanophage infection-sensitive' to 'cyanophage infection-insensitive' cells, rather than influencing the total number of Microcystis sp. It was found that nucleotide sequence of the g91 gene fragment isolated from Central Europe was 95% similar to that of its counterparts from East Asia. However, the research based on molecular primers specific to the Microcystis sp. viruses is limitted to two of the known strains to date. It is suggested that further studies in molecular biology and ecology of Microcystis sp. cyanophages should be based on metagenomics accompanied with physicochemical environmental variables.

AB The Namib Desert is one of the world's only truly coastal desert ecosystem. Until the end of the 1st decade of the twenty-first century, very little was known of the microbiology of this southwestern African desert, with the few reported studies being based solely on culture-dependent approaches. However, from 2010, an intense research program was undertaken by researchers from the University of the Western Cape Institute for Microbial Biotechnology and Metagenomics, and subsequently the University of Pretoria Centre for Microbial Ecology and Genomics, and their collaborators, led to a more detailed understanding of the ecology of the indigenous microbial communities in many Namib Desert biotopes. Namib Desert soils and the associated specialized niche communities are inhabited by a wide array of prokaryotic, lower eukaryotic and virus/phage taxa. These communities are highly heterogeneous on both small and large spatial scales, with community composition impacted by a range of macro- and micro-environmental factors, from water regime to soil particle size. Community functionality is also surprisingly non-homogeneous, with some taxa retaining functionality even under hyper-arid soil conditions, and with subtle changes in gene expression and phylotype abundances even on diel timescales. Despite the growing understanding of the structure and function of Namib Desert microbiomes, there remain enormous gaps in our knowledge. We have yet to quantify many of the processes in these soil communities, from regional nutrient cycling to community growth rates. Despite the progress that has been made, we still have little knowledge of either the role of phages in microbial community dynamics or inter-species interactions. Furthermore, the intense research efforts of the past decade have highlighted the immense scope for future microbiological research in this dynamic, enigmatic and charismatic region of Africa.

AB Viruses drive microbial diversity, function and evolution and influence important biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems. Despite their relevance, we currently lack an understanding of their potential impacts on stream biofilm structure and function. This is surprising given the critical role of biofilms for stream ecosystem processes. Currently, the study of viruses in stream biofilms is hindered by the lack of an optimized protocol for their extraction, concentration and purification. Here, we evaluate a range of methods to separate viral particles from stream biofilms, and to concentrate and purify them prior to DNA extraction and metagenome sequencing. Based on epifluorescence microscopy counts of viral-like particles (VLP) and DNA yields, we optimize a protocol including treatment with tetrasodium pyrophosphate and ultra-sonication to disintegrate biofilms, tangential-flow filtration to extract and concentrate VLP, followed by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose density gradient to isolate VLP from the biofilm slurry. Viromes derived from biofilms sampled from three different streams were dominated by Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae and provide first insights into the viral diversity of stream biofilms. Our protocol optimization provides an important step towards a better understanding of the ecological role of viruses in stream biofilms.

AB Interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere occur at the air-sea interface through the transfer of momentum, heat, gases and particulate matter, and through the impact of the upper-ocean biology on the composition and radiative properties of this boundary layer. The Tara Pacific expedition, launched in May 2016 aboard the schooner Tara, was a 29-month exploration with the dual goals to study the ecology of reef ecosystems along ecological gradients in the Pacific Ocean and to assess inter-island and open ocean surface plankton and neuston community structures. In addition, key atmospheric properties were measured to study links between the two boundary layer properties. A major challenge for the open ocean sampling was the lack of ship-time available for work at "stations". The time constraint led us to develop new underway sampling approaches to optimize physical, chemical, optical, and genomic methods to capture the entire community structure of the surface layers, from viruses to metazoans in their oceanographic and atmospheric physicochemical context. An international scientific consortium was put together to analyze the samples, generate data, and develop datasets in coherence with the existing Tara Oceans database. Beyond adapting the extensive Tara Oceans sampling protocols for high-resolution underway sampling, the key novelties compared to Tara Oceans' global assessment of plankton include the measurement of (i) surface plankton and neuston biogeography and functional diversity; (ii) bioactive trace metals distribution at the ocean surface and metal-dependent ecosystem structures; (iii) marine aerosols, including biological entities; (iv) geography, nature and colonization of microplastic; and (v) high-resolution underway assessment of net community production via equilibrator inlet mass spectrometry. We are committed to share the data collected during this expedition, making it an important resource important resource to address a variety of scientific questions.

AB Wild waterfowl birds are known to be the main reservoir for a variety of avian influenza viruses of different subtypes. Some subtypes, such as H2Nx, H8Nx, H12Nx, and H14Nx, occur relatively rarely in nature. During 10-year long-term surveillance, we isolated five rare H12N5 and one H12N2 viruses in three different distinct geographic regions of Northern Eurasia and studied their characteristics. H12N2 from the Far East region was a double reassortant containing hemagglutinin (HA), non-structural (NS) and nucleoprotein (NP) segments of the American lineage and others from the classical Eurasian avian-like lineage. H12N5 viruses contain Eurasian lineage segments. We suggest a phylogeographical scheme for reassortment events associated with geographical groups of aquatic birds and their migration flyways. The H12N2 virus is of particular interest as this subtype has been found in common teal in the Russian Far East region, and it has a strong relation to North American avian influenza virus lineages, clearly showing that viral exchange of segments between the two continents does occur. Our results emphasize the importance of Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) surveillance in Northern Eurasia for the annual screening of virus characteristics, including the genetic constellation of rare virus subtypes, to understand the evolutionary ecology of AIV.

AB Giant viruses, like pandoraviruses and mimiviruses, have been discovered from diverse environments, and their broad global distribution has been established. Here, we report two new isolates of Pandoravirus spp. and one Mimivirus sp., named Pandoravirus hades, Pandoravirus persephone, and Mimivirus sp. isolate styx, co-isolated from riverbank soil in Japan. We obtained nearly complete sequences of the family B DNA polymerase gene (polB) of P. hades and P. persephone; the former carried two known intein regions, while the latter had only one. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two new pandoravirus isolates are closely related to Pandoravirus dulcis. Furthermore, random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed that P. hades and P. persephone might harbor different genome structures. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the partial polB sequence, Mimivirus sp. isolate styx belongs to mimivirus lineage A. DNA staining suggested that the Pandoravirus spp. asynchronously replicates in amoeba cells while Mimivirus sp. replicates synchronously. We also observed that P. persephone- or Mimivirus sp. isolate styx-infected amoeba cytoplasm is extruded by the cells. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the isolation of pandoraviruses in Asia. In addition, our results emphasize the importance of virus isolation from soil to reveal the ecology of giant viruses.

AB Bacteriophages are abundant in the environment, yet the vast majority have not been discovered or described. Many characterized bacteriophages infect a small subset of Enterobacteriaceae hosts. Despite its similarity to Escherichia coli, the pathogenic Shigella fleacneri has relatively few known phages, which exhibit significant differences from many E. coli phages. This suggests that isolating additional Shigella phages is necessary to further explore these differences. To address questions of novelty and prevalence, high school students isolated bacteriophages on non-pathogenic strains of enteric bacteria. Results indicate that Shigella phages are abundant in the environment and continue to differ significantly from E. coli phages. Our findings suggest that Shigella-infecting members of the Ounavirinae subfamily continue to be over-represented and show surprisingly low diversity within and between sampling sites. Additionally, a podophage with distinct genomic and structural properties suggests that continued isolation on non-model species of bacteria is necessary to truly understand bacteriophage diversity.

AB Aquatic birds are known to be a reservoir for the most common influenza A viruses (IAVs). In the annual surveillance program, we collected the feces of migratory birds for the detection of IAVs in South Korea in November 2016. A novel reassorted H3N3 avian influenza virus (AIV) containing genes from viruses of wild and domestic birds was identified and named A/aquatic bird/South Korea/sw006/2016(H3N3). The polymerase basic 2 (PB2) and non-structural (NS) genes of this isolate are most closely related to those of wild-bird-origin AIV, while the polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix (M) genes are most closely related to those of domestic-bird-origin AIV. A/aquatic bird/South Korea/sw006/2016 contains PA, NP, M, and NS genes were most closely related to those of AIV subtype H4 and PB2, PB1, and HA genes that are most closely related to those of AIV subtype H3N8, while the NA gene was most closely related to those of subtype H10, which was recently detected in humans in China. These results suggest that novel reassortment of AIV strains occurred due to interaction between wild and domestic birds. Hence, we emphasize the need for continued surveillance of avian influenza virus in bird populations.

AB Planktonic photosynthetic organisms of the class Mamiellophyceae include the smallest eukaryotes (less than 2 mu m), are globally distributed and form the basis of coastal marine ecosystems. Eight complete fully annotated 13-22 Mb genomes from three genera, Ostreococcus, Bathycoccus and Micromonas, are available from previously isolated clonal cultured strains and provide an ideal resource to explore the scope and challenges of analysing single cell amplified genomes (SAGs) isolated from a natural environment. We assembled data from 12 SAGs sampled during the Tara Oceans expedition to gain biological insights about their in situ ecology, which might be lost by isolation and strain culture. Although the assembled nuclear genomes were incomplete, they were large enough to infer the mating types of four Ostreococcus SAGs. The systematic occurrence of sequences from the mitochondria and chloroplast, representing less than 3% of the total cell's DNA, intimates that SAGs provide suitable substrates for detection of non-target sequences, such as those of virions. Analysis of the non-Mamiellophyceae assemblies, following filtering out cross-contaminations during the sequencing process, revealed two novel 1.6 and 1.8 kb circular DNA viruses, and the presence of specific Bacterial and Oomycete sequences suggests that these organisms might co-occur with the Mamiellales.

AB Reassortment is an evolutionary mechanism by which influenza A viruses (IAV) generate genetic novelty. Reassortment is an important driver of host jumps and is widespread according to retrospective surveillance studies. However, predicting the epidemiological risk of reassortant emergence in novel hosts from surveillance data remains challenging. IAV strains persist and co-occur in the environment, promoting co-infection during environmental transmission. These conditions offer opportunity to understand reassortant emergence in reservoir and spillover hosts. Specifically, environmental RNA could provide rich information for understanding the evolutionary ecology of segmented viruses, and transform our ability to quantify epidemiological risk to spillover hosts. However, significant challenges with recovering and interpreting genomic RNA from the environment have impeded progress towards predicting reassortant emergence from environmental surveillance data. We discuss how the fields of genomics, experimental ecology and epide miological modelling are well positioned to address these challenges. Coupling quantitative disease models and natural transmission studies with new molecular technologies, such as deep-mutational scanning and single-virus sequencing of environmental samples, should dramatically improve our understanding of viral co-occurrence and reassortment. We define observable risk metrics for emerging molecular technologies and propose a conceptual research framework for improving accuracy and efficiency of risk prediction.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.

AB Phages infecting members of the opportunistic human pathogen, Salmonella enterica, are widespread in natural environments and offer a potential source of agents that could be used for controlling populations of this bacterium; yet, relatively little is known about these phages. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of 45 phages of Salmonella enterica from disparate geographic locations within British Columbia, Canada. Host-range profiling revealed host-specific patterns of susceptibility and resistance, with several phages identified that have a broad-host range (i.e., able to lyse >40% of bacterial hosts tested). One phage in particular, SE13, is able to lyse 51 out of the 61 Salmonella strains tested. Comparative genomic analyses also revealed an abundance of sequence diversity in the sequenced phages. Alignment of the genomes grouped the phages into 12 clusters with three singletons. Phages within certain clusters exhibited extraordinarily high genome homology (>98% nucleotide identity), yet between clusters, genomes exhibited a span of diversity (<50% nucleotide identity). Alignment of the major capsid protein also supported the clustering pattern observed with alignment of the whole genomes. We further observed associations between genomic relatedness and the site of isolation, as well as genetic elements related to DNA metabolism and host virulence. Our data support the knowledge framework for phage diversity and phage-host interactions that are required for developing phage-based applications for various sectors, including biocontrol, detection and typing.

AB Bacteriophages encode host-acquired functional genes known as auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). Photosynthesis AMGs are commonly found in marine cyanobacteria-infecting Myoviridae and Podoviridae cyanophages, but their ecology remains understudied in freshwater environments. To advance knowledge of this issue, we analysed viral metagenomes collected in the summertime for four years from five lakes and two estuarine locations interconnected by the Chattahoochee River, Southeast USA. Sequences representing ten different AMGs were recovered and found to be prevalent in all sites. Most freshwater AMGs were 10-fold less abundant than estuarine and marine AMGs and were encoded by novel Myoviridae and Podoviridae cyanophage genera. Notably, several of the corresponding viral genomes showed endemism to a specific province along the river. This translated into psbA gene phylogenetic clustering patterns that matched a marine vs. freshwater origin indicating that psbA may serve as a robust classification and source-tracking biomarker. Genomes classified in a novel viral lineage represented by isolate S-EIVl contained psbA, which is unprecedented for this lineage. Collectively, our findings indicated that the acquisition of photosynthesis AMGs is a widespread strategy used by cyanophages in aquatic ecosystems, and further indicated the existence of viral provinces in which certain viral species and/or genotypes are locally abundant.

AB Soils impact global carbon cycling and their resident microbes are critical to their biogeochemical processing and ecosystem outputs. Based on studies in marine systems, viruses infecting soil microbes likely modulate host activities via mortality, horizontal gene transfer, and metabolic control. However, their roles remain largely unexplored due to technical challenges with separating, isolating, and extracting DNA from viruses in soils. Some of these challenges have been overcome by using whole genome amplification methods and while these have allowed insights into the identities of soil viruses and their genomes, their inherit biases have prevented meaningful ecological interpretations. Here we experimentally optimized steps for generating quantitatively-amplified viral metagenomes to better capture both ssDNA and dsDNA viruses across three distinct soil habitats along a permafrost thaw gradient. First, we assessed differing DNA extraction methods (PowerSoil, Wizard mini columns, and cetyl trimethylammonium bromide) for quantity and quality of viral DNA. This established PowerSoil as best for yield and quality of DNA from our samples, though similar to 1/3 of the viral populations captured by each extraction kit were unique, suggesting appreciable differential biases among DNA extraction kits. Second, we evaluated the impact of purifying viral particles after resuspension (by cesium chloride gradients; CsCl) and of viral lysis method (heat vs bead-beating) on the resultant viromes. DNA yields after CsCl particle-purification were largely non-detectable, while unpurified samples yielded 1-2-fold more DNA after lysis by heat than by bead-beating. Virome quality was assessed by the number and size of metagenome-assembled viral contigs, which showed no increase after CsCI-purification, but did from heat lysis relative to bead-beating. We also evaluated sample preparation protocols for ssDNA virus recovery. In both CsCl-purified and non-purified samples, ssDNA viruses were successfully recovered by using the Accel-NGS 1S Plus Library Kit. While ssDNA viruses were identified in all three soil types, none were identified in the samples that used bead-beating, suggesting this lysis method may impact recovery. Further, 13 ssDNA vOTUs were identified compared to 582 dsDNA vOTUs, and the ssDNA vOTUs only accounted for similar to 4% of the assembled reads, implying dsDNA viruses were dominant in these samples. This optimized approach was combined with the previously published viral resuspension protocol into a sample-to-virome protocol for soils now available at protocols.io, where community feedback creates 'living' protocols. This collective approach will be particularly valuable given the high physicochemical variability of soils, which will may require considerable soil type-specific optimization. This optimized protocol provides a starting place for developing quantitatively-amplified viromic datasets and will help enable viral ecogenomic studies on organic-rich soils.

AB Background Individual helminth infections are ubiquitous in the tropics; geographical overlaps in endemicity and epidemiological reports suggest areas endemic for multiple helminthiases are also burdened with high prevalences of intestinal protozoan infections, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite this, pathogens tend to be studied in isolation, and there remains a need for a better understanding of the community ecology and health consequences of helminth polyparasitism to inform the design of effective parasite control programs.
   Methodology We performed meta-analyses to (i) evaluate the commonality of polyparasitism for helminth-helminth, helminth-intestinal protozoa, helminth-malaria, helminth-TB, and helminth-HIV co-infections, (ii) assess the potential for interspecies interactions among helminth-helminth and helminth-intestinal protozoan infections, and (iii) determine the presence and magnitude of association between specific parasite pairs. Additionally, we conducted a review of reported health consequences of multiply-infected individuals compared to singly- or not multiply-infected individuals.
   Principal findings We found that helminth-helminth and helminth-intestinal protozoan multiple infections were significantly more common than single infections, while individuals with malaria, TB, and HIV were more likely to be singly-infected with these infections than co-infected with at least one helminth. Most observed species density distributions significantly differed from the expected distributions, suggesting the potential presence of interspecies interactions. All significant associations between parasite pairs were positive in direction, irrespective of the combination of pathogens. Polyparasitized individuals largely exhibited lower hemoglobin levels and higher anemia prevalence, while the differences in growth-related variables were mostly statistically insignificant.
   Conclusions Our findings confirm that helminth polyparasitism and co-infection with major diseases is common in the tropics. A multitude of factors acting at various hierarchical levels, such as interspecies interactions at the within-host infra-parasite community level and environmental variables at the higher host community level, could explain the observed positive associations between pathogens; there remains a need to develop new frameworks which can consider these multilevel factors to better understand the processes structuring parasite communities to accomplish their control.
   Author summary Helminth infections are a highly prevalent global health problem. These parasitic worm infections occur in areas also burdened with intestinal protozoan infections, malaria, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus. While these pathogens tend to be studied in isolation, there remains a need to better understand the nature, extent, and health consequences of helminth polyparasitism and co-infection with major diseases. Here, we reviewed the literature and performed meta-analyses to evaluate the commonality of helminth polyparasitism and co-infection, the potential for interspecies interactions between parasites, the association between parasite pairs, and the health consequences among multiply-infected individuals. We confirmed that polyparasitism and co-infection with major diseases are common in the global South and found that multiply-infected individuals experienced worse health consequences when compared to singly or not-multiply infected individuals. Our analysis suggested the potential presence of interspecies interactions and we identified the existence of positive associations between parasite pairs. These findings support the call for integrating deworming into malaria, TB, and HIV treatment protocols and suggest there remains a need to improve our understanding of the factors influencing co-transmission to achieve sustainable parasite control.

ID EVOLUTION; CHINA; GENESIS
AB Domestic ducks are considered as the interface between wild aquatic birds and terrestrial poultry and play an important role in the transmission and evolution of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). However, the infectivity of H9N2 AIVs in different domestic duck species has not been systematically evaluated. Here we investigated the infectivity of various genotypes of chicken H9N2 AIVs in Pekin duck (Anas Platyrhynchos), Mallard duck (Anas Platyrhynchos) and Muscovy duck (Cairina Moschata) through intranasal inoculation. We found that Pekin ducks and Mallard ducks were generally resistant to chicken H9N2 virus infection, while Muscovy ducks were relatively susceptible to H9N2 AIVs. All the tested viruses were isolated from oropharynx, trachea and lung tissues of Muscovy ducks. Additionally, genotype 57 (G57) H9N2 AIVs, which was predominant in chickens since 2010, showed increased virus replication in this duck species, indicating an improved interspecies transmission ability of recent H9N2 viruses from chickens to ducks. Our results demonstrated the role of Muscovy ducks in the ecology of H9N2 AIVs. More attentions should be paid to this host during viral surveillances. Additionally, inactivated H9N2 vaccine may be unnecessarily used in Pekin and Mallard ducks.

AB Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in seawater. They influence microbial population dynamics, genetic heterogeneity and biogeochemical cycles in marine ecosystems. The isolation and characterization of viruses that infect specific hosts have greatly advanced our knowledge of the biological and ecological interactions between viruses and their hosts. Marine Roseobacter are abundant, ubiquitous and diverse in the ocean and play active roles in global biogeochemical cycling, especially the sulfur cycle. Currently, 32 bacteriophages that infect multiple lineages of roseobacters have been isolated and sequenced. These roseophages exhibit diverse morphologies, nucleic acid types and genomic features. Here, we provide the most up-to-date overview of roseophages. Most roseophages are host specific and have a wide range of genome sizes and open reading frames. Based on a genome-wide comparison, at least eight distinctly different types of roseophages were identified, indicating their diversity. Lysogenic-related and gene transfer agent-related genes are commonly found in roseophage genomes, implying the importance of genetic transfer within roseobacters. This feature could provide the versatility for roseobacters to quickly adapt to the changing environments. A wide distribution range of roseophages in the global ocean, especially in coastal environments, has been observed, reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of the Roseobacter lineage.

AB Cylindrospermopsis (Raphidiopsis) raciborskii is an invasive, filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium that forms frequent blooms in freshwater habitats. While viruses play key roles in regulating the abundance, production and diversity of their hosts in aquatic ecosystems, the role(s) of viruses in the ecology of C. raciborskii is almost unexplored. Progress in this field has been hindered by the absence of a characterized virus-host system in C. raciborskii. To bridge this gap, we sequenced the genome of CrV-01T, a previously isolated cyanosiphovirus, and its host, C. raciborskii strain Cr2010. Analyses suggest that CrV-01T represents a distinct clade of siphoviruses infecting, and perhaps lysogenizing, filamentous cyanobacteria. Its genome contains unique features that include an intact CRISPR array and a 12 kb inverted duplication. Evidence suggests CrV-01T recently gained the ability to infect Cr2010 and recently lost the ability to form lysogens. The cyanobacterial host contains a CRISPR-Cas system with CRISPR spacers matching protospacers within the inverted duplication of the CrV-01T genome. Examination of metagenomes demonstrates that viruses with high genetic identity to CrV-01T, but lacking the inverted duplication, are present in C. raciborskii blooms in Australia. The unique genomic features of the CrV/Cr2010 system offers opportunities to investigate in more detail virus-host interactions in an ecologically important bloom-forming cyanobacterium.

AB Bacteriophages are widely considered to influence bacterial communities, however most phages are still unknown or not studied well enough to understand their ecological roles. We have isolated two phages infecting Lentibacter sp. SH36, affiliated with the marine Roseobacter group, and retrieved similar phage genomes from publicly available metagenomics databases. Phylogenetic analysis placed the new phages within the Cobavirus group, in the here newly proposed genus Siovirus and subfamily Riovirinae of the Podoviridae. Gene composition and presence of direct terminal repeats in cultivated cobaviruses point toward a genome replication and packaging strategy similar to the T7 phage. Investigation of the genomes suggests that viral lysis of the cell proceeds via the canonical holin-endolysin pathway. Cobaviral hosts include members of the genera Lentibacter, Sulfitobacter and Celeribacter of the Roseobacter group within the family Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria). Screening more than 5,000 marine metagenomes, we found cobaviruses worldwide from temperate to tropical waters, in the euphotic zone, mainly in bays and estuaries, but also in the open ocean. The presence of cobaviruses in protist metagenomes as well as the phylogenetic neighborhood of cobaviruses in glutaredoxin and ribonucleotide reductase trees suggest that cobaviruses could infect bacteria associated with phototrophic or grazing protists. With this study, we expand the understanding of the phylogeny, classification, genomic organization, biogeography and ecology of this phage group infecting marine Rhodobacteraceae.

AB Background: Since 2008, avian influenza surveillance in poultry-related environments has been conducted annually in China. Samples have been collected from environments including live poultry markets, wild bird habitats, slaughterhouses, and poultry farms. Multiple subtypes of avian influenza virus have been identified based on environmental surveillance, and an H1N8 virus was isolated from the drinking water of a live poultry market.
   Methods: Virus isolation was performed by inoculating influenza A-positive specimens into embryonated chicken eggs. Next-generation sequencing was used for whole-genome sequencing. A solid-phase binding assay was performed to test the virus receptor binding specificity. Trypsin dependence plaque formation assays and intravenous pathogenicity index tests were used to evaluate virus pathogenicity in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Different cell lines were chosen for comparison of virus replication capacity.
   Results: According to the phylogenetic trees, the whole gene segments of the virus named A/Environment/Fujian/85144/2014(H1N8) were of Eurasian lineage. The HA, NA, PB1, and M genes showed the highest homology with those of H1N8 or H1N2 subtype viruses isolated from local domestic ducks, while the PB2, PA, NP and NS genes showed high similarity with the genes of H7N9 viruses detected in 2017 and 2018 in the same province. This virus presented an avian receptor binding preference. The plaque formation assay showed that it was a trypsin-dependent virus. The intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) in chickens was 0.02. The growth kinetics of the A/Environment/Fujian/85144/2014(H1N8) virus in different cell lines were similar to those of a human-origin virus, A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1), but lower than those of the control avian-origin and swine-origin viruses.
   Conclusions: The H1N8 virus was identified in avian influenza-related environments in China for the first time and may have served as a gene carrier involved in the evolution of the H7N9 virus in poultry. This work further emphasizes the importance of avian influenza virus surveillance, especially in live poultry markets (LPMs). Active surveillance of avian influenza in LPMs is a major pillar supporting avian influenza control and response.

AB So far, studies on the bacterial immune system CRISPR-Cas and its ecological and evolutionary effects have been largely limited to laboratory conditions. While providing crucial information on the constituents of CRISPR-Cas, such studies may overlook fundamental components that affect bacterial immunity in natural habitats. Translating laboratory-derived predictions to nature is not a trivial task, owing partly to the instability of natural communities and difficulties in repeated sampling. To this end, we review how aquaculture, the farming of fishes and other aquatic species, may provide suitable semi-natural laboratories for examining the role of CRISPR-Cas in phage/bacterium coevolution. Existing data from disease surveillance conducted in aquaculture, coupled with growing interest towards phage therapy, may have already resulted in large collections of bacterium and phage isolates. These data, combined with premeditated efforts, can provide empirical evidence on phage-bacterium dynamics such as the bacteriophage adherence to mucus hypothesis, phage life cycles and their relationship with CRISPR-Cas and other immune defences. Typing of CRISPR spacer content in pathogenic bacteria can also provide practical information on diversity and origin of isolates during outbreaks. In addition to providing information of CRISPR functionality and phage-bacterium dynamics, aquaculture systems can significantly impact perspectives on design of phage-based disease treatment at the current era of increasing antibiotic resistance.
   This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The ecology and evolution of prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems'.

AB The occurrence of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 during a non-outbreak period in Lake Victoria was studied and genetic characteristics for environmental persistence and relatedness to pandemic strains were assessed. We analyzed 360 samples of carps, phytoplankton and water collected in 2017 during dry and rainy seasons in the Tanzanian basin of Lake Victoria. Samples were tested using PCR (ompW and ctxA) with DNA extracted from bacterial isolates and samples enriched in alkaline peptone water. Isolates were screened with polyvalent antiserum O1 followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools were employed to investigate the genomic characteristics of the isolates. More V. cholerae positive samples were recovered by PCR when DNA was obtained from enriched samples than from isolates (69.0% vs. 21.3%, p < 0.05), irrespectively of season. We identified ten V. cholerae O1 among 22 ctxA-positive isolates. Further studies are needed to serotype the remaining ctxA-positive non-O1 strains. Sequenced strains belonged to El Tor atypical biotype of V. cholerae O1 of MLST ST69 harboring the seventh pandemic gene. Major virulence genes, ctxA, ctxB, zot, ace, tcpA, hlyA, rtxA, ompU, toxR, T6SS, alsD, makA and pathogenicity islands VPI-1, VPI-2, VSP-1, and VSP-2 were found in all strains. The strains contained Vibrio polysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes, the mshA gene and two-component response regulator proteins involved in stress response and autoinducers for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. They carried the SXT integrative conjugative element with phenotypic and genotypic resistance to aminoglycoside, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, phenicol, and quinolones. Strains contained a multidrug efflux pump component and were resistant to toxic compounds with copper homeostasis and cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance proteins. The environmental strains belonged to the third wave of the seventh pandemic and most are genetically closely related to recent outbreak strains from Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda with as low as three SNPs difference. Some strains have persisted longer in the environment and were more related to older outbreak strains in the region. V. cholerae O1 of outbreak potential seem to persist in Lake Victoria through interactions with fish and phytoplankton supported by the optimum water parameters and intrinsic genetic features enhancing survival in the aquatic environment.

AB Marine viruses impact global biogeochemical cycles via their influence on host community structure and function, yet our understanding of viral ecology is constrained by limitations in host culturing and a lack of reference genomes and 'universal' gene markers to facilitate community surveys. Short-read viral metagenomic studies have provided clues to viral function and first estimates of global viral gene abundance and distribution, but their assemblies are confounded by populations with high levels of strain evenness and nucleotide diversity (microdiversity), limiting assembly of some of the most abundant viruses on Earth. Such features also challenge assembly across genomic islands containing niche-defining genes that drive ecological speciation. These populations and features may be successfully captured by single-virus genomics and fosmid-based approaches, at least in abundant taxa, but at considerable cost and technical expertise. Here we established a low-cost, low-input, high throughput alternative sequencing and informatics workflow to improve viral metagenomic assemblies using short-read and long-read technology. The 'VirION' (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing) approach was first validated using mock communities where it was found to be as relatively quantitative as short-read methods and provided significant improvements in recovery of viral genomes. We then then applied VirION to the first metagenome from a natural viral community from the Western English Channel. In comparison to a short-read only approach, VirION: (i) increased number and completeness of assembled viral genomes; (ii) captured abundant, highly microdiverse virus populations, and (iii) captured more and longer genomic islands. Together, these findings suggest that VirION provides a high throughput and cost-effective alternative to fosmid and single-virus genomic approaches to more comprehensively explore viral communities in nature.

AB Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is widespread in the evolution of prokaryotes, especially those associated with the human body. Here, we implemented large-scale gene-species phylogenetic tree reconstructions and reconciliations to identify putative HGT-derived genes in the reference genomes of microbiota isolated from six major human body sites by the NIH Human Microbiome Project. Comparisons with a control group representing microbial genomes from diverse natural environments indicated that HGT activity increased significantly in the genomes of human microbiota, which is confirmatory of previous findings. Roughly, more than half of total genes in the genomes of human-associated microbiota were transferred (donated or received) by HGT. Up to 60% of the detected HGTs occurred either prior to the colonization of the human body or involved bacteria residing in different body sites. The latter could suggest 'genetic crosstalk' and movement of bacterial genes within the human body via hitherto poorly understood mechanisms. We also observed that HGT activity increased significantly among closely-related microorganisms and especially when they were united by physical proximity, suggesting that the 'phylogenetic effect' can significantly boost HGT activity. Finally, we identified several core and widespread genes least influenced by HGT that could become useful markers for building robust 'trees of life' and address several outstanding technical challenges to improve the phylogeny-based genome-wide HGT detection method for future applications.

AB Some giant viruses are ecological agents that are predicted to be involved in the top-down control of single-celled eukaryotic algae populations in aquatic ecosystems. Despite an increased interest in giant viruses since the discovery and characterization of Mimivirus and other viral giants, little is known about their physiology and ecology. In this study, we characterized the genome and functional potential of a giant virus that infects the freshwater haptophyte Chrysochromulina parva, originally isolated from Lake Ontario. This virus, CpV-BQ2, is a member of the nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) group and possesses a 437 kb genome encoding 503 ORFs with a GC content of 25%. Phylogenetic analyses of core NCLDV genes place CpV-BQ2 amongst the emerging group of algae-infecting Mimiviruses informally referred to as the "extended Mimiviridae," making it the first virus of this group to be isolated from a freshwater ecosystem. During genome analyses, we also captured and described the genomes of three distinct virophages that co-occurred with CpV-BQ2 and likely exploit CpV for their own replication. These virophages belong to the polinton-like viruses (PLV) group and encompass 19-23 predicted genes, including all of the core PLV genes as well as several genes implicated in genome modifications. We used the CpV-BQ2 and virophage reference sequences to recruit reads from available environmental metatranscriptomic data to estimate their activity in fresh waters. We observed moderate recruitment of both virus and virophage transcripts in samples obtained during Microcystis aeruginosa blooms in Lake Erie and Lake Tai, China in 2013, with a spike in activity in one sample. Virophage transcript abundance for two of the three isolates strongly correlated with that of the CpV-BQ2. Together, the results highlight the importance of giant viruses in the environment and establish a foundation for future research on the physiology and ecology CpV-BQ2 as a model system for algal Mimivirus dynamics in freshwaters.

AB There have been three waves of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in commercial, backyard poultry, and wild birds in Ukraine. The first (2005-2006) and second (2008) waves were caused by H5N1 HPAI virus, with 45 outbreaks among commercial poultry (chickens) and backyard fowl (chickens, ducks, and geese) in four regions of Ukraine (AR Crimea, Kherson, Odesa, and Sumy Oblast). H5N1 HPAI viruses were isolated from dead wild birds: cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus) in 2006 and 2008. The third HPAI wave consisted of nine outbreaks of H5N8 HPAI in wild and domestic birds, beginning in November 2016 in the central and south regions (Kherson, Odesa, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, and Mykolaiv Oblast). H5N8 HPAI virus was detected in dead mute swans (Cygnus olor), peacocks (Pavo cristatus) (in zoo), ruddy shelducks (Tadorna ferruginea), white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), and from environmental samples in 2016 and 2017. Wide wild bird surveillance for avian influenza (AI) virus was conducted from 2006 to 2016 in Ukraine regions suspected of being intercontinental (north-south and east-west) flyways. A total of 21 511 samples were collected from 105 species of wild birds representing 27 families and 11 orders. Ninety-five avian influenza (AI) viruses were isolated (including one H5N2 LPAI virus in 2010) from wild birds with a total of 26 antigenic hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) combinations. Fifteen of 16 known avian HA subtypes were isolated. Two H5N8 HPAI viruses (2016-2017) and two H5N2 LPAI viruses (2016) were isolated from wild birds and environmental samples (fresh bird feces) during surveillance before the outbreak in poultry in 2016-2017. The Ukrainian H5N1, H5N8 HPAI, and H5N2 LPAI viruses belong to different H5 phylogenetic groups. Our results demonstrate the great diversity of AI viruses in wild birds in Ukraine, as well as the importance of this region for studying the ecology of avian influenza.

AB Wild birds in the order Anseriformes are important reservoirs for influenza A viruses (IAVs); however, IAV prevalence and subtype diversity may vary by season, even at the same location. To better understand the ecology of IAV during waterfowl migration through the Gulf Coast of the United States (Louisiana and Texas), surveillance of blue-winged (Spatula discors) and American green-winged (Anas carolinensis) teal was conducted. The surveillance was done annually during the spring (live capture; 2012-17) and fall (hunter harvested; 2007-17) at times inferred to coincide with northward and southward movements, respectively, for these waterfowl species. During spring migration, 266 low pathogenicity (LP) IAV positive samples were recovered from 7547 paired cloacal-oropharyngeal (COP) samples (prevalence, 3.5%; annual range, 1.3%-8.4%). During fall migration, 650 LP IAV-positive samples were recovered from 9493 COP samples (prevalence, 6.8%; annual range, 0.4%-23.5%). Overall, 34 and 20 different IAV subtypes were recovered during fall and spring sampling, respectively. Consistent with previous results for fall migrating ducks, H3 and H4 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes were most common; however, H4 subtype viruses predominated every year. This is in contrast to the predominance of LP H7 and H10 HA subtype viruses during spring. The N6 and N8 neuraminidase subtypes, which were usually associated with H4, were most common during fall; the N6 subtype was not recovered in the spring. These consistent seasonal trends in IAV subtype detection in teal are currently not understood and highlight the need for further research regarding potential drivers of spatiotemporal patterns of infection, such as population immunity.

AB Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses can silently circulate in poultry and wild aquatic birds and potentially mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. In the U.S., recent emergence and spread of H7N8 and H7N9 HPAI viruses not only caused devastating losses to domestic poultry but also underscored the capability of LPAI viruses to mutate into HPAI viruses. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated pathogenicity and transmissibility of H7N8 and H7N9 LPAI viruses (the progenitors of HPAI viruses) in chickens and turkeys. We also included H7N2 isolated from an outbreak of LPAI in commercial chickens. H7 viruses replicated more efficiently in the respiratory tract than in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that their replication is restricted to the upper respiratory tract. Specifically, H7N2 replicated most efficiently in two-week-old chickens and turkeys. In contrast, H7N8 replicated least efficiently in those birds. Further, replication of H7N2 and H7N9 was restricted in the upper respiratory tract of four-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and broiler chickens. Despite their restricted replication, the two viruses efficiently transmitted from infected to naive birds by direct contact, leading to seroconversion of contacted chickens. Our findings suggest the importance of continuous monitoring and surveillance of LPAI viruses in the fields.

AB The poles constitute 14% of the Earth's biosphere: The aquatic Arctic surrounded by land in the north, and the frozen Antarctic continent surrounded by the Southern Ocean. In spite of an extremely cold climate in addition to varied topographies, the polar aquatic regions are teeming with microbial life. Even in sub-glacial regions, cellular life has adapted to these extreme environments where perhaps there are traces of early microbes on Earth. As grazing by macrofauna is limited in most of these polar regions, viruses are being recognized for their role as important agents of mortality, thereby influencing the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients that, in turn, impact community dynamics at seasonal and spatial scales. Here, we review the viral diversity in aquatic polar regions that has been discovered in the last decade, most of which has been revealed by advances in genomics-enabled technologies, and we reflect on the vast extent of the still-to-be explored polar microbial diversity and its enigmatic virosphere.

AB Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging arbovirus that was first isolated in South Africa in 1959. This Flavivirus is maintained in the environment through a typical enzootic cycle involving mosquitoes and birds. USUV has spread to a large part of the European continent over the two decades mainly leading to substantial avian mortalities with a significant recrudescence of bird infections recorded throughout Europe within the few last years. USUV infection in humans is considered to be most often asymptomatic or to cause mild clinical signs. Nonetheless, a few cases of neurological complications such as encephalitis or meningoencephalitis have been reported. USUV and West Nile virus (WNV) share many features, like a close phylogenetic relatedness and a similar ecology, with co-circulation frequently observed in nature. However, USUV has been much less studied and in-depth comparisons of the biology of these viruses are yet rare. In this review, we discuss the main body of knowledge regarding USUV and compare it with the literature on WNV, addressing in particular virological and clinical aspects, and pointing data gaps.

AB Wild aquatic birds are the major reservoir of influenza A virus. Cloacal swabs and feces samples (n = 6595) were collected from 62 bird species in Argentina from 2006 to 2016 and screened for influenza A virus. Full genome sequencing of 15 influenza isolates from 6 waterfowl species revealed subtypes combinations that were previously described in South America (H1N1, H4N2, H4N6 (n= 3), H5N3, H6N2 (n = 4), and H10N7 (n = 2)), and new ones not previously identified in the region (H4N8, H7N7 and H7N9). Notably, the internal gene segments of all 15 Argentine isolates belonged to the South American lineage, showing a divergent evolution of these viruses in the Southern Hemisphere. Time-scaled phylogenies indicated that South American gene segments diverged between similar to 30 and similar to 140 years ago from the most closely related influenza lineages, which include the avian North American (PB1, HA, NA, MP, and NS-B) and Eurasian lineage (PB2), and the equine H3N8 lineage (PA, NP, and NS-A). Phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene segments of the H4, H6, and N8 subtypes revealed recent introductions and reassortment between viruses from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the Americas. Remarkably and despite evidence of recent hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtype introductions, the phylogenetic composition of internal gene constellation of these influenza A viruses has remained unchanged. Considering the extended time and the number of sampled species of the current study, and the paucity of previously available data, our results contribute to a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of influenza virus in South America.

AB Advances brought about by omics-based approaches have revolutionized our understanding of the diversity and ecological processes involving marine archaea, bacteria, and their viruses. This broad review discusses recent examples of how genomics, metagenomics, and ecogenomics have been applied to reveal the ecology of these biological entities. Three major topics are covered in this revision: (i) the novel roles of microorganisms in ecosystem processes; (ii) virus-host associations; and (iii) ecological associations of microeukaryotes and other microbes. We also briefly comment on the discovery of novel taxa from marine ecosystems; development of a robust taxonomic framework for prokaryotes; breakthroughs on the diversity and ecology of cyanobacteria; and advances on ecological modelling. We conclude by discussing limitations of the field and suggesting directions for future research.

AB Pelagic cyanobacteria are key players in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and their viruses (cyanophages) potentially affect the abundance and composition of cyanobacterial communities. Yet, there are few well-described freshwater cyanophages relative to their marine counterparts, and in general, few cyanosiphoviruses (family Siphoviridae) have been characterized, limiting our understanding of the biology and the ecology of this prominent group of viruses. Here, we characterize S-LBS1, a freshwater siphovirus lytic to a phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus isolate (Strain TCC793). S-LBS1 has a narrow host range, a burst size of similar to 400 and a relatively long infecting step before cell lysis occurs. It has a dsDNA 34,641 bp genome with putative genes for structure, DNA packing, lysis, replication, host interactions, DNA repair and metabolism. S-LBS1 is similar in genome size, genome architecture, and gene content, to previously described marine siphoviruses also infecting PE-rich Synechococcus, e.g., S-CBS1 and S-CBS3. However, unlike other Synechococcus phages, S-LBS1 encodes an integrase, suggesting its ability to establish lysogenic relationships with its host. Sequence recruitment from viral metagenomic data showed that S-LBS1-like viruses are diversely present in a wide range of aquatic environments, emphasizing their potential importance in controlling and structuring Synechococcus populations. A comparative analysis with 16 available sequenced cyanosiphoviruses reveals the absence of core genes within the genomes, suggesting high degree of genetic variability in siphoviruses infecting cyanobacteria. It is likely that cyanosiphoviruses have evolved as distinct evolutionary lineages and that adaptive co-evolution occurred between these viruses and their hosts (i.e., Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, Nodularia, and Acaryochloris), constituting an important driving force for such phage diversification.

AB Urbanization rapidly changes landscape structure worldwide, thereby enlarging the human-wildlife interface. The emerging urban structures should have a key influence on the spread and distribution of wildlife diseases such as canine distemper, by shaping density, distribution and movements of wildlife. However, little is known about the role of urban structures as proxies for disease prevalence. To guide management, especially in densely populated cities, assessing the role of landscape structures in hampering or promoting disease prevalence is thus of paramount importance. Between 2008 and 2013, two epidemic waves of canine distemper hit the urban red fox (Vulpes vulpes) population of Berlin, Germany. The directly transmitted canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a virulent disease infecting a range of mammals with high host mortality, particularly in juveniles. We extracted information about CDV serological state (seropositive or seronegative), sex and age for 778 urban fox carcasses collected by the state laboratory Berlin Brandenburg. To assess the impact of urban landscape structure heterogeneity (e.g., richness) and shares of green and gray infrastructures at different spatial resolutions (areal of 28 ha, 78 ha, 314 ha) on seroprevalence we used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models with binomial distributions. Our results indicated that predictors derived at a 28 ha resolution were most informative for describing landscape structure effects (AUC = 0.92). The probability to be seropositive decreased by 66% (0.6 to 0.2) with an increasing share of gray infrastructure (40 to 80%), suggesting that urbanization might hamper CDV spread in urban areas, owing to a decrease in host density (e.g., less foxes or raccoons) or an absence of wildlife movement corridors in strongly urbanized areas. However, less strongly transformed patches such as close-to-nature areas in direct proximity to water bodies were identified as high risk areas for CDV transmission. Therefore, surveillance and disease control actions targeting urban wildlife or human-wildlife interactions should focus on such areas. The possible underlying mechanisms explaining the prevalence distribution may be increased isolation, the absence of alternative hosts or an abiotic environment, all impairing the ability of CDV to persist without a host.

AB Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are the dominant primary producers in marine ecosystems and perform a significant fraction of ocean carbon fixation. These cyanobacteria interact with a diverse microbial community that coexists with them. Comparative genomics of cultivated isolates has helped address questions regarding patterns of evolution and diversity among microbes, but the fraction that can be cultivated is miniscule compared to the diversity in the wild. To further probe the diversity of these groups and extend the utility of reference sequence databases, we report a data set of single cell genomes for 489 Prochlorococcus, 50 Synechococcus, 9 extracellular virus particles, and 190 additional microorganisms from a diverse range of bacterial, archaeal, and viral groups. Many of these uncultivated single cell genomes are derived from samples obtained on GEOTRACES cruises and at well-studied oceanographic stations, each with extensive suites of physical, chemical, and biological measurements. The genomic data reported here greatly increases the number of available Prochlorococcus genomes and will facilitate studies on evolutionary biology, microbial ecology, and biological oceanography.

AB Cyanophages are viruses with a wide distribution in aquatic ecosystems, that specifically infect Cyanobacteria. These viruses can be readily isolated from marine and fresh waters environments; however, their presence in cosmopolitan thermophilic phototrophic mats remains largely unknown. This study investigates the morphological diversity (TEM), taxonomic composition (metagenomics), and active infectivity (metatranscriptomics) of viral communities over a thermal gradient in hot spring phototrophic mats from Northern Patagonia (Chile). The mats were dominated (up to 53%) by cosmopolitan thermophilic filamentous true-branching cyanobacteria from the genus Mastigocladus, the associated viral community was predominantly composed of Caudovirales (70%), with most of the active infections driven by cyanophages (up to 90% of Caudovirales transcripts). Metagenomic assembly lead to the first full genome description of a T7-like Thermophilic Cyanophage recovered from a hot spring (Porcelana Hot Spring, Chile), with a temperature of 58 degrees C (TC-CHP58). This could potentially represent a world-wide thermophilic lineage of podoviruses that infect cyanobacteria. In the hot spring, TC-CHP58 was active over a temperature gradient from 48 to 66 degrees C, showing a high population variability represented by 1979 single nucleotide variants (SNVs). TC-CHP58 was associated to the Mastigocladus spp. by CRISPR spacers. Marked differences in metagenomic CRISPR loci number and spacers diversity, as well as SNVs, in the TC-CHP58 proto-spacers at different temperatures, reinforce the theory of coevolution between natural virus populations and cyanobacterial hosts. Considering the importance of cyanobacteria in hot spring biogeochemical cycles, the description of this new cyanopodovirus lineage may have global implications for the functioning of these extreme ecosystems.

AB Bats are highly diverse and ecologically valuable mammals. They serve as host to bacteria, viruses and fungi that are either beneficial or harmful to its colony as well as to other groups of cave organisms. The bacterial diversity of two bat guano samples, C1 and C2, from Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan, Philippines were investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. V3-V4 hypervariable regions were amplified and then sequenced using Illumina MiSeq 250 PE system. Reads were processed using Mothur and QIIME pipelines and assigned 12,345 OTUs for C1 and 5,408 OTUs for C2. The most dominant OTUs in C1 belong to the Proteobacteria (61.7%), Actinobacteria (19.4%), Bacteroidetes (4.2%), Firmicutes (2.7%), Chloroflexi (2.5%), candidate phylum TM7 (2.3%) and Planctomycetes (1.9%) while Proteobacteria (61.7%) and Actinobacteria (34.9%) dominated C2. Large proportion of sequence reads mainly associated with unclassified bacteria indicated possible occurrence of novel bacteria in both samples. XRF spectrophotometric analyses of C1 and C2 guano revealed significant differences in the composition of both major and trace elements. C1 guano recorded high levels of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ti and Cu while C2 samples registered high concentrations of Ca, P, S, Zn and Cr. Community structure of the samples were compared with other published community profiling studies from Finland (SRR868695), Meghalaya, Northeast India (SRR1793374) and Maharashtra State, India (CGS). Core microbiome among samples were determined for comparison. Variations were observed among previously studied guano samples and the Cabalyorisa Cave samples were attributed to either bat sources or age of the guano. This is the first study on bacterial diversity of guano in the Philippines through high-throughput sequencing.

AB Background: The genomes of halophilic archaea (haloarchaea) often comprise multiple replicons. Genomic variation in haloarchaea has been linked to viral infection pressure and, in the case of Antarctic communities, can be caused by intergenera gene exchange. To expand understanding of genome variation and biogeography of Antarctic haloarchaea, here we assessed genomic variation between two strains of Halorubrum lacusprofundi that were isolated from Antarctic hypersaline lakes from different regions (Vestfold Hills and Rauer Islands). To assess variation in haloarchaeal populations, including the presence of genomic islands, metagenomes from six hypersaline Antarctic lakes were characterised.
   Results: The sequence of the largest replicon of each Hrr. lacusprofundi strain (primary replicon) was highly conserved, while each of the strains' two smaller replicons (secondary replicons) were highly variable. Intergenera gene exchange was identified, including the sharing of a type I-B CRISPR system. Evaluation of infectivity of an Antarctic halovirus provided experimental evidence for the differential susceptibility of the strains, bolstering inferences that strain variation is important for modulating interactions with viruses. A relationship was found between genomic structuring and the location of variation within replicons and genomic islands, demonstrating that the way in which haloarchaea accommodate genomic variability relates to replicon structuring. Metagenome read and contig mapping and clustering and scaling analyses demonstrated biogeographical patterning of variation consistent with environment and distance effects. The metagenome data also demonstrated that specific haloarchaeal species dominated the hypersaline systems indicating they are endemic to Antarctica.
   Conclusion: The study describes how genomic variation manifests in Antarctic-lake haloarchaeal communities and provides the basis for future assessments of Antarctic regional and global biogeography of haloarchaea.

AB Despite the abundance, ubiquity and impact of environmental viruses, their inherent genomic plasticity and extreme diversity pose significant challenges for the examination of bacteriophages on Earth. Viral metagenomic studies have offered insight into broader aspects of phage ecology and repeatedly uncover genes to which we are currently unable to assign function. A combined effort of phage isolation and metagenomic survey of Chicago's nearshore waters of Lake Michigan revealed the presence of Pbunaviruses, relatives of the Pseudomonas phage PB1. This prompted our expansive investigation of PB1-like phages. Genomic signatures of PB1-like phages and Pbunaviruses were identified, permitting the unambiguous distinction between the presence/absence of these phages in soils, freshwater and wastewater samples, as well as publicly available viral metagenomic datasets. This bioinformatic analysis led to the de novo assembly of nine novel PB1-like phage genomes from a metagenomic survey of samples collected from Lake Michigan. While this study finds that Pbunaviruses are abundant in various environments of Northern Illinois, genomic variation also exists to a considerable extent within individual communities.

We performed the transcriptome analysis for A. longirostris and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between samples from the Iheya North hydrothermal vent (HV) and a methane seep in the South China Sea (MS). From the 57,801 annotated unigenes, multi-copies of enzyme family members for eliminating toxic xenobiotics were isolated and seven putatively duplicated gene clusters of cytochrome P450s were discovered, which may contribute to adaptation to the harsh conditions. Eight single amino acid substitutions of a Rhodopsin gene with low expression in two deep-sea alvinocaridid species were positively selected when compared with shallow water shrimps, which may be the result of adaptation to the dim-light environment in deep sea. 408 DEGs were identified with 53 and 355 up-regulated in HV and MS, respectively. Various genes associated with sulfur metabolism, detoxification and mitochondria were included, revealing different mechanisms of adaptation to the two types of extreme environments. All results are expected to serve as important basis for the further study.

AB Viruses are recognized as important actors in ocean ecology and biogeochemical cycles, but many details are not yet understood. We participated in a winter expedition to the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, to isolate viruses and to measure virus-like particle abundance (flow cytometry) in sea ice. We isolated 59 bacterial strains and the first four Antarctic sea-ice viruses known (PANV1, PANV2, OANV1 and OANV2), which grow in bacterial hosts belonging to the typical sea-ice genera Paraglaciecola and Octadecabacter. The viruses were specific for bacteria at the strain level, although OANV1 was able to infect strains from two different classes. Both PANV1 and PANV2 infected 11/15 isolated Paraglaciecola strains that had almost identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, but the plating efficiencies differed among the strains, whereas OANV1 infected 3/7 Octadecabacter and 1/15 Paraglaciecola strains and OANV2 1/7 Octadecabacter strains. All the phages were cold-active and able to infect their original host at 0 degrees C and 4 degrees C, but not at higher temperatures. The results showed that virus-host interactions can be very complex and that the viral community can also be dynamic in the winter-sea ice.

AB Vibrio is a cosmopolitan genus of marine bacteria, highly investigated in coastal and estuarine environments. Vibrio have also been isolated from pelagic waters, yet very little is known about the ecology of these oligotrophic species. In this study we examined the relative change in bacterial abundance and more specifically the dynamics of Vibrio in the tropical North Atlantic in response to the arrival of pulses of Saharan dust aerosols, a major source of biologically important nutrients for downwind marine surface waters. Aerosol and surface water samples were collected over 1 month coinciding with at least two distinct dust events. Total bacterial counts increased by 1.6-fold correlating with the arrival of Saharan dust (r = 0.76; p = 0.001). Virus-like particles (VLP) also followed this trend and were correlated with bacterial counts (r = 0.67; p = 0.01). Vibrio specific qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene ranged from below detection limits to a high of 9,145 gene copies ml(-1) with the arrival of dust. This increase equated to 6.5 x 10(2)-1.5 x 10(3) individual genome equivalents ml(-1) based on the known range of 16S rRNA copies among this genus. Vibrio exhibited bloom-bust cycles potentially attributed to selective viral lysis or bloom depletion of organic carbon. This work is one of the few studies to examine the open ocean ecology of Vibrio, a conditionally rare taxon, whose bloom-bust lifestyle likely is a contributing factor in the flow of nutrients and energy in pelagic ecosystems.

AB Bacteriophages play significant role in driving microbial diversity; however, little is known about the diversity of phages in different ecosystems. A dynamic predator-prey mechanism called "kill the winner" suggests the elimination of most active bacterial populations through phages. Thus, interaction between phage and host has an effect on the composition of microbial communities in ecosystems. In this study, secondary phage metagenome data from aquatic habitats: wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), fresh, marine, and hot water spring habitat were analyzed using MG-RAST and STAMP tools to explore the diversity of the viruses. Differential relative abundance of phage families-Siphoviridae (34%) and Myoviridae (26%) in WWTP, Myoviridae (30%) and Podoviridae (23%) in fresh water, and Myoviridae (41%) and Podoviridae (8%) in marine-was found to be a discriminating factor among four habitats while Rudiviridae (9%), Globuloviridae (8%), and Lipothrixviridae (1%) were exclusively observed in hot water spring. Subsequently, at genera level, Bpp-1-like virus, Chlorovirus, and T4-like virus were found abundant in WWTP, fresh, and marine habitat, respectively. PCA analysis revealed completely disparate composition of phage in hot water spring from other three ecosystems. Similar analysis of relative abundance of functional features corroborated observations from taxa analysis. Functional features corresponding to phage packaging machinery, replication, integration and excision, and gene transfer discriminated among four habitats. The comparative metagenomics approach exhibited genetically distinct phage communities among four habitats. Results revealed that selective distribution of phage communities would help in understanding the role of phages in food chains, nutrient cycling, and microbial ecology. Study of specific phages would also help in controlling environmental pathogens including MDR bacterial populations using phage therapy approach by selective mining and isolation of phages against specific pathogens persisting in a given environment.

AB While our knowledge about the roles of microbes and viruses in the ocean has increased tremendously due to recent advances in genomics and metagenomics, research on marine microbial eukaryotes and zooplankton has benefited much less from these new technologies because of their larger genomes, their enormous diversity, and largely unexplored physiologies. Here, we use a metatranscriptomics approach to capture expressed genes in open ocean Tara Oceans stations across four organismal size fractions. The individual sequence reads cluster into 116 million unigenes representing the largest reference collection of eukaryotic transcripts from any single biome. The catalog is used to unveil functions expressed by eukaryotic marine plankton, and to assess their functional biogeography. Almost half of the sequences have no similarity with known proteins, and a great number belong to new gene families with a restricted distribution in the ocean. Overall, the resource provides the foundations for exploring the roles of marine eukaryotes in ocean ecology and biogeochemistry.

AB Kelp forests provide essential habitats for organisms in temperate rocky shores. Loss of kelp forests has occurred over large areas in a number of temperate regions, including in Australia, where the dominant kelp Ecklonia radiata has been lost from substantial areas of the shoreline. Loss of E. radiata has been associated with environmental stressors, including increased temperature and anthropogenic contaminants, as well as biological factors, such as herbivory. Disease may also play a role, but there is little information on the role of disease in the loss of kelp from coastal ecosystems or on the potential role of pathogenic microorganisms, such as viruses. E. radiata across much of its distribution in Australia can develop a "bleached" phenotype, which may be a disease. To investigate whether the phenotype was associated with a potential viral agent, we shotgun sequenced viral particles that were isolated from kelp with normal (healthy) and bleached phenotypes. Each virome consisted of similar to 380,000 reads, of which similar to 25% were similar to known viruses. All samples were dominated by bacteriophages, but novel ssDNA virus sequences were detected that were almost exclusively in viromes from the bleached kelp phenotype. These ssDNA viruses are covered by 11 contigs that contained complete capsids and characteristic rep genes that were 30-60% similar to those of circular, Rep-encoding ssDNA viruses (CRESS-DNA viruses). CRESS-DNA viruses have not previously been described from macroalgae, and the rep genes were similar to CRESS-DNA viruses from marine water samples, snails, crabs, anemones, but also dragonflies. This raises the interesting possibility that the kelp could be a vector of the CRESS-DNA viruses to other organisms that are associated with the bleached state.

AB The Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve in the Cape Floral Kingdom in South Africa is known for its unique plant biodiversity. The potential presence of unique microbial and viral biodiversity associated with this unique plant biodiversity led us to explore the fynbos soil using metaviromic techniques. In this study, metaviromes of a soil community from the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve has been characterised in detail for the first time. Metaviromic DNA was recovered from soil and sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing. The MetaVir, MG-RAST and VIROME bioinformatics pipelines were used to analyse taxonomic composition, phylogenetic and functional assessments of the sequences. Taxonomic composition revealed members of the order Caudovirales, in particular the family Siphoviridae, as prevalent in the soil samples and other compared viromes. Functional analysis and other metaviromes showed a relatively high frequency of phage-related and structural proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of PolB, PolB2, terL and T7gp17 genes indicated that many viral sequences are closely related to the order Caudovirales, while the remainder were distinct from known isolates. The use of single virome which only includes double stranded DNA viruses limits this study. Novel phage sequences were detected, presenting an opportunity for future studies aimed at targeting novel genetic resources for applied biotechnology.

TI Investigation of prevalence of free Shiga toxinproducing Escherichia

AB Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) causes approximately 265,000 illnesses and 3,600 hospitalizations annually and is highly associated with animal contamination due to the natural reservoir of ruminant gastrointestinal tracts. Free STEC-specific bacteriophages against STEC strains are also commonly isolated from fecal-contaminated environment. Previous studies have evaluated the correlation between the prevalence of STEC-specific bacteriophages and STEC strains to improve animal-associated environment. However, the similar information regarding free STEC-specific bacteriophages prevalence in produce growing area is lacking. Thus, the objectives of this research were to determine the prevalence of STEC-specific phages, analyze potential effects of environmental factors on the prevalence of the phages, and study correlations between STEC-specific bacteriophages and the bacterial hosts in pre-harvest produce environment. Surface water from 20 samples sites was subjected to free bacteriophage isolation using host strains of both generic E. coli and STEC (O157, six non-O157 and one O179 strains) cocktails, and isolation of O157 and non-O157 STEC strains by use of culture methods combined with PCR-based confirmation. The weather data were obtained from weather station website. Free O145-and O179-specific bacteriophages were the two most frequently isolated bacteriophages among all (O45, O145, O157 and O179) in this study. The results showed June and July had relatively high prevalence of overall STEC-specific bacteriophages with minimum isolation of STEC strains. In addition, the bacteriophages were likely isolated in the area D around or within city D with predominant human impact, whereas the STEC bacterial isolates were commonly found in agriculture impact environment. Furthermore, there was a trend that the sample sites with positive of free STEC bacteriophage did not have the specific STEC bacterial hosts. The findings of the study enable us to understand the ecology between free STEC-specific phages and STEC bacteria for further pre-harvest food safety management in produce environment.

TI Mosquito and Virus Surveillance as a Predictor of Human Ross River Virus

AB Mosquito and virus surveillance systems are widely used in Western Australia (WA) to support public health efforts to reduce mosquito-borne disease. However, these programs are costly to maintain on a long-term basis. Therefore, we aimed to assess the validity of mosquito numbers and Ross River virus (RRV) isolates from surveillance trap sites as predictors of human RRV cases in south-west WA between 2003 and 2014. Using negative binomial regression modeling, mosquito surveillance was found to be a useful tool for predicting human RRV cases. In eight of the nine traps, when adjusted for season, there was an increased risk of RRV cases associated with elevated mosquito numbers detected 1 month before the onset of human cases for at least one quartile compared with the reference group. The most predictive urban trap sites were located near saltmarsh mosquito habitat, bushland that could sustain macropods and densely populated residential suburbs. This convergence of environments could allow enzootic transmission of RRV to spillover and infect the human population. Close proximity of urban trap sites to each other suggested these sites could be reduced. Ross River virus isolates were infrequent at some trap sites, so ceasing RRV isolation from mosquitoes at these sites or where isolates were not predictive of human cases could be considered. In future, trap sites could be reduced for routine surveillance, allowing other environments to be monitored to broaden the understanding of RRV ecology in the region. A more cost-effective and efficient surveillance program may result from these modifications.

AB Viruses play an important role in the control of microbial communities, and it has been suggested that the influence of viruses in polar ecosystems, with low nutrients and under extreme environmental conditions, may be greater. Viral metagenomics allows the genetic characterization of complex viral communities without the need to isolate and grow viruses. Recent investigations in Antarctica and the Arctic are uncovering a great diversity of DNA viruses, including bacteriophages, circular single-stranded DNA viruses, algal-infecting phycodnaviruses, and virophages, adapted to these extreme environments. The limited sequence similarity between viruses in Antarctica and the Arctic suggests that viral communities in the two polar regions have evolved independently since the formation of the Antarctic continent, estimated to occur 25 million years ago. The community of RNA viruses in Antarctica is dominated by the order Picornavirales and their quasispecies composition suggests that higher genetic variability may correlate with viral adaptation to new environmental conditions.

AB Wind blowing over aquatic and terrestrial surfaces produces aerosols, which include microbial aerosols. We studied the effect of onshore wind speeds on aerosol concentrations as well as total and culturable microbial aerosols (bacterial and viral) at an urban waterfront (New York, NY, USA). We used two distinct methods to characterize microbial aerosol responses to wind speed: A culture-based exposure-plate method measuring viable bacterial deposition near-shore (CFU accumulation rate); and a culture-independent aerosol sampler-based method measuring total bacterial and viral aerosols (cells m(-3) air). While ambient coarse (>2 mu m) and fine (0.3-2 mu m) aerosol particle number concentrations (regulated indicators of air quality) decreased with increasing onshore wind speeds, total and depositing culturable bacterial aerosols and total viral aerosols increased. Taxonomic identification of the 16S rDNA of bacterial aerosol isolates suggested both terrestrial and aquatic sources. Wind appears to increase microbial aerosol number concentrations in the near-shore environment by onshore transport at low wind speeds (<4 m s(-1)), and increased local production and transport of new microbial aerosols from adjacent water surfaces at higher wind speeds (>4 m s(-1)). This study demonstrates a wind-modulated microbial connection between water and air in the coastal urban environment, with implications for public health management and urban microbial ecology.

AB Cholera epidemics have been recorded periodically in Vietnam during the seventh cholera pandemic. Since cholera is a water-borne disease, systematic monitoring of environmental waters for Vibrio cholerae presence is important for predicting and preventing cholera epidemics. We conducted monitoring, isolation, and genetic characterization of V. cholerae strains in Nam Dinh province of Northern Vietnam from Jul 2013 to Feb 2015. In this study, four V. cholerae O1 strains were detected and isolated from 110 analyzed water samples (3.6%); however, none of them carried the cholera toxin gene, ctxA, in their genomes. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four O1 isolates were separated into two independent clusters, and one of them diverged from a common ancestor with pandemic strains. The analysis of pathogenicity islands (CTX prophage, VPI-I, VPI-II, VSP-I, and VSP-II) indicated that one strain (VNND_2014Jun_6SS) harbored an unknown prophage-like sequence with high homology to vibriophage KSF-1 phi and VCY phi, identified from Bangladesh and the USA, respectively, while the other three strains carried tcpA gene with a distinct sequence demonstrating a separate clonal lineage. These results suggest that the aquatic environment can harbor highly divergent V. cholera strains and serve as a reservoir for multiple V. cholerae virulence-associated genes which may be exchanged via mobile genetic elements. Therefore, continuous monitoring and genetic characterization of V. cholerae strains in the environment should contribute to the early detection of the sources of infection and prevention of cholera outbreaks as well as to understanding the natural ecology and evolution of V. cholerae.

AB Our understanding of archaeal virus diversity and structure is just beginning to emerge. Here we describe a new archaeal virus, tentatively named Metallosphaera turreted icosahedral virus (MTIV), that was isolated from an acidic hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Two strains of the virus were identified and were found to replicate in an archaeal host species closely related to Metallosphaera yellowstonensis. Each strain encodes a 9.8-to 9.9-kb linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome with large inverted terminal repeats. Each genome encodes 21 open reading frames (ORFs). The ORFs display high homology between the strains, but they are quite distinct from other known viral genes. The 70-nm-diameter virion is built on a T = 28 icosahedral lattice. Both single particle cryoelectron microscopy and cryotomography reconstructions reveal an unusual structure that has 42 turret-like projections: 12 pentameric turrets positioned on the icosahedral 5-fold axes and 30 turrets with apparent hexameric symmetry positioned on the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Both the virion structural properties and the genome content support MTIV as the founding member of a new family of archaeal viruses.
   IMPORTANCE Many archaeal viruses are quite different from viruses infecting bacteria and eukaryotes. Initial characterization of MTIV reveals a virus distinct from other known bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeal viruses; this finding suggests that viruses infecting Archaea are still an understudied group. As the first known virus infecting a Metallosphaera sp., MTIV provides a new system for exploring archaeal virology by examining host-virus interactions and the unique features of MTIV structure-function relationships. These studies will likely expand our understanding of virus ecology and evolution.

AB Depending on the specific viral pathogen, commensal bacteria can promote or reduce the severity of viral infection and disease progression in their hosts. Influenza A virus (IAV) has a broad host range, comprises many subtypes, and utilizes different routes of transmission, including the fecal-oral route in wild birds. It has been previously demonstrated that commensal bacteria can interact with the host's immune system to protect against IAV pathogenesis. However, it is unclear whether bacteria and their products may be interacting directly with IAV to impact virion stability. Herein we show that gastrointestinal (GI) tract bacterial isolates in an in vitro system significantly reduce the stability of IAV. Moreover, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), found on the exterior surfaces of bacteria, was sufficient to significantly decrease the stability of both human and avian viral strains in a temperature-dependent manner, including at the relevant temperatures of their respective hosts and the external aquatic habitat. The subtype and host origin of the viruses were shown to affect the extent to which IAV was susceptible to LPS. Furthermore, using a receptor binding assay and transmission electron microscopy, we observed that LPS binds to and alters the morphology of influenza virions, suggesting that direct interaction with the viral surface contributes to the observed antiviral effect of LPS on influenza.
   IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus (IAV), transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route in wild birds, encounters high concentrations of bacteria and their products. Understanding the extent to which bacteria affect the infectivity of IAV will lead to a broader understanding of viral ecology in reservoir hosts and may lead to insights for the development of therapeutics in respiratory infection. Herein we show that bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interact with and destabilize influenza virions. Moreover, we show that LPS reduces the long-term persistence and freeze-thaw stability of IAV, which is important information for modeling the movement and emergence of novel strains from animal hosts. Our results, demonstrating that the subtype and host origin of a virus also influence its susceptibility to LPS, raise key questions about the fitness of viruses in reservoir hosts, their potential to transmit to humans, and the importance of bacterial-viral interactions in viral ecology.

AB Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen commonly found in environments of seafood processing, thus presenting a challenge for eradication from seafood processing facilities. Monitoring the prevalence and subtype diversity of L. monocytogenes together with phages that are specific to Listeria spp. ("Listeria phages") will provide knowledge on the bacteria-phage ecology in food processing plants. In this work, a total of 595 samples were collected from raw material, finished seafood products and environmental samples from different sites of a seafood processing plant during 17 sampling visits in 1.5 years of study. L monocytogenes and Listeria spp. (non-monocytogenes) were found in 22 (3.7%) and 43 (7.2%) samples, respectively, whereas 29 Listeria phages were isolated from 9 (1.5%) phage-positive samples. DNA fingerprint analysis of L. monocytogenes isolates revealed 11 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles, with two subtypes were frequently observed over time. Our data reveal a presence of Listeria phages within the same seafood processing environments where a diverse set of L monocytogenes subtypes was also found. Although serotype 4b was observed at lower frequency, data indicate that isolates from this seafood processing plant belonged to both epidemiologically important serotypes 1/2a and 4b, which may suggest a potential public health risk. Phages (all showed a unique genome size of 65 +/- 2 kb) were classified into 9 host range groups, representing both broad- and narrow-host range. While most L monocytogenes isolates from this facility were susceptible to phages, five isolates showed resistance to 12-20 phages. Variations in phage host range among Listeria phages isolated from food processing plant may affect a presence of a diverse set of L. monocytogenes isolates derived from the same processing environment in Thailand.

AB Eurasian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has been a severe threat to the poultry industry since its emergence in 1996. The carcass or tissues derived from infected birds may present the risk of the virus spreading to humans, animals, and the surrounding environment. In this study, we investigated the survival of the virus in feather, muscle, and liver tissues collected from six chickens (Gallus gallus) experimentally infected with HPAI H5N1 virus. The tissues were stored at +4 degrees C or +20 degrees C, and viral isolation was performed at different times for 360 days. The maximum periods for viral survival were observed in samples stored at +4 degrees C in all tissue types and were 240 days in feather tissues, 160 days in muscle, and 20 days in liver. The viral infectivity at +20 degrees C was maintained for a maximum of 30 days in the feather tissues, 20 days in muscle, and 3 days in liver. The viral inactivation rates partly overlapped in the feather and muscle tissues at the two temperatures. The virus was inactivated rapidly in the liver. Our experimental results indicate that the tissue type and temperature can greatly influence the survival of HPAI H5N1 virus in the tissues of infected chickens.
   IMPORTANCE Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype can cause massive losses of poultry, and people need to handle a large number of chicken carcasses contaminated with the virus at outbreak sites. This study evaluated how long the virus can keep its infectivity in the three types of tissues derived from chickens infected with the virus. Our experimental results indicate that the virus can survive in tissues for a specific period of time depending on the tissue type and temperature. Our results are valuable for better understanding of viral ecology in the environment and for reducing the risk of the virus spreading via bird tissues contaminated with the virus.

AB Viruses influence the ecology and evolutionary trajectory of microbial communities. Yet our understanding of their roles in ecosystems is limited by the paucity of model systems available for hypothesis generation and testing. Further, virology is limited by the lack of a broadly accepted conceptual framework to classify viral diversity into evolutionary and ecologically cohesive units. Here, we introduce genomes, structural proteomes, and quantitative host range data for eight Pseudoalteromonas phages isolated from Helgoland (North Sea, Germany) and use these data to advance a genome-based viral operational taxonomic unit (OTU) definition. These viruses represent five new genera and inform 498 unaffiliated or unannotated protein clusters (PCs) from global virus metagenomes. In a comparison of previously sequenced Pseudoalteromonas phage isolates (n = 7) and predicted prophages (n = 31), the eight phages are unique. They share a genus with only one other isolate, Pseudoalteromonas podophage RIO-1 (East Sea, South Korea) and two Pseudoalteromonas prophages. Mass-spectrometry of purified viral particles identified 12-20 structural proteins per phage. When combined with 3-D structural predictions, these data led to the functional characterization of five previously unidentified major capsid proteins. Protein functional predictions revealed mechanisms for hijacking host metabolism and resources. Further, they uncovered a hybrid sipho-myovirus that encodes genes for Mu-like infection rarely described in ocean systems. Finally, we used these data to evaluate a recently introduced definition for virus populations that requires members of the same population to have >95% average nucleotide identity across at least 80% of their genes. Using physiological traits and genomics, we proposed a conceptual model for a viral OTU definition that captures evolutionarily cohesive and ecologically distinct units. In this trait-based framework, sensitive hosts are considered viral niches, while host ranges and infection efficiencies are tracked as viral traits. Quantitative host range assays revealed conserved traits within virus OTUs that break down between OTUs, suggesting the defined units capture niche and fitness differentiation. Together these analyses provide a foundation for model system-based hypothesis testing that will improve our understanding of marine copiotrophs, as well as phage-host interactions on the ocean particles and aggregates where Pseudoalteromonas thrive.

AB Background: As the natural hosts of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), aquatic and migratory birds provide a gene pool for genetic transfer among species and across species, forming transient "genome constellations." This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H1NX based on the complete molecular characterization of eight genes of viruses that were collected from 2014 to 2015 in Anhui Province, China.
   Methods: Hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used to determine the hemagglutination (HA) activity of the HA subtypes. The entire genomes of the viruses were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3500xl DNA Analyzer. The sequences were genetically analysed to study their genetic evolution using DNASTAR and MEGA 6. The pathogenic effects of the viruses were evaluated using mouse infection models.
   Results: Seven strains of the H1 subtype avian influenza virus were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis indicated natural recombination of the H1 influenza viruses between the Eurasian lineage and the North American lineage. Some genes had high sequence identity with A/bean goose/Korea/220/2011(H9N2), which is a typical case involving viral reassortment between the Eurasian lineage and the North American lineage. The results of infection experiments in mice showed that the viruses could acquire the ability to multiply in mouse respiratory organs without adaptation.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that continued surveillance of wild birds, particularly migratory birds, is important to provide early warning of possible H1 influenza epidemics and to understand the ecology of the virus.

AB Despite studies of viromes isolated from aquatic environments are becoming increasingly frequent, most of them are limited to the characterization of viral taxonomy. Bacterial reads in viromes are abundant but the extent to which this genetic material is playing a role in the ecology of aquatic microbiology remains unclear. To this aim, we developed of a useful approach for the characterization of viral and microbial communities of aquatic environments with a particular focus on the identification of microbial genes harbored in the viromes. Virus-like particles were isolated from water samples collected across the Lambro River, from the spring to the high urbanized Milan area. The derived viromes were analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing looking for the presence, relative abundance of bacterial genes with particular focus on those genes involved in antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes have been identified in all virome samples together with a high abundance of reads assigned to cellular processes and signaling. Virome data compared to those identified in the microbiome isolated from the same sample revealed differences in terms of functional categories and their relative abundance. To verify the role of aquatic viral population in bacterial gene transfer, water-based mesocosms were perturbed or not perturbed with a low dose of tetracycline. The results obtained by qPCR assays revealed variation in abundance of tet genes in the virome and microbiome highlighting a relevant role of viral populations in microbial gene mobilization.

AB Background: Erythrobacter comprises a widespread and ecologically significant genus of marine bacteria. However, no phage infecting Erythrobacter spp. has been reported to date. This study describes the isolation and characterization of phage vB_EliS-R6L from Erythrobacter.
   Methods: Standard virus enrichment and double-layer agar methods were used to isolate and characterize the phage. Morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy, and a one-step growth curve assay was performed. The phage genome was sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform and annotated using standard bioinformatics tools. Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on the deduced amino acid sequences of terminase, endolysin, portal protein, and major capsid protein, and genome recruitment analysis was conducted using Jiulong River Estuary Virome, Pacific Ocean Virome and Global Ocean Survey databases.
   Results: A novel phage, vB_EliS-R6L, from coastal waters of Xiamen, China, was isolated and found to infect the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis DSM 8509. Morphological observation and genome analysis revealed that phage vB_EliS-R6L is a siphovirus with a 65.7-kb genome that encodes 108 putative gene products. The phage exhibits growth at a wide range of temperature and pH conditions. Genes encoding five methylase-related proteins were found in the genome, and recognition site predictions suggested its resistance to restriction-modification host systems. Genomic comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicate that phage vB_EliS-R6L is distinct from other known phages. Metagenomic recruitment analysis revealed that vB_EliS-R6L like phages are widespread in marine environments, with likely distribution in coastal waters.
   Conclusions: Isolation of the first Erythrobacter phage (vB_EliS-R6L) will contribute to our understanding of host-phage interactions, the ecology of marine Erythrobacter and viral metagenome annotation efforts.

AB The Roseobacter clade is abundant and widespread in marine environments and plays an important role in oceanic biogeochemical cycling. In this present study, a lytic siphophage (labeled vB_DshS-R5C) infecting the strain type of Dinoroseobacter shibae named DFL12(T), which is part of the Roseobacter clade, was isolated from the oligotrophic South China Sea. Phage R5C showed a narrow host range, short latent period and low burst size. The genome length of phage R5C was 77, 874 bp with a G+C content of 61.5%. Genomic comparisons detected no genome matches in the GenBank database and phylogenetic analysis based on DNA polymerase I revealed phylogenetic features that were distinct to other phages, suggesting the novelty of R5C. Several auxiliary metabolic genes (e.g., phoH gene, heat shock protein and queuosine biosynthesis genes) were identified in the R5C genome that may be beneficial to the host and/or offer a competitive advantage for the phage. Among siphophages infecting the Roseobacter clade (roseosiphophages), four gene transfer agent- like genes were commonly located with close proximity to structural genes, suggesting that their function may be related to the tail of siphoviruses. The isolation and characterization of R5C demonstrated the high genomic and physiological diversity of roseophages as well as improved our understanding of host-phage interactions and the ecology of the marine Roseobacter.

AB Background: Over the past 20 years, many marine seabird populations have been gradually declining and the factors driving this ongoing deterioration are not always well understood. Avipoxvirus infections have been found in a wide range of bird species worldwide, however, very little is known about the disease ecology of avian poxviruses in seabirds. Here we present two novel avipoxviruses from pacific shearwaters (Ardenna spp), one from a Flesh-footed Shearwater (A. carneipes) (SWPV-1) and the other from a Wedge-tailed Shearwater (A. pacificus) (SWPV-2).
   Results: Epidermal pox lesions, liver, and blood samples were examined from A. carneipes and A. pacificus of breeding colonies in eastern Australia. After histopathological confirmation of the disease, PCR screening was conducted for avipoxvirus, circovirus, reticuloendotheliosis virus, and fungal agents. Two samples that were PCR positive for poxvirus were further assessed by next generation sequencing, which yielded complete Shearwaterpox virus (SWPV) genomes from A. pacificus and A. carneipes, both showing the highest degree of similarity with Canarypox virus (98% and 67%, respectively). The novel SWPV-1 complete genome from A. carneipes is missing 43 genes compared to CNPV and contains 4 predicted genes which are not found in any other poxvirus, whilst, SWPV-2 complete genome was deemed to be missing 18 genes compared to CNPV and a further 15 genes significantly fragmented as to probably cause them to be non-functional.
   Conclusion: These are the first avipoxvirus complete genome sequences that infect marine seabirds. In the comparison of SWPV-1 and -2 to existing avipoxvirus sequences, our results indicate that the SWPV complete genome from A. carneipes (SWPV-1) described here is not closely related to any other avipoxvirus genome isolated from avian or other natural host species, and that it likely should be considered a separate species.

AB Viruses influence the ecology and diversity of phytoplankton in the ocean. Most studies of phytoplankton host-virus interactions have focused on bloom-forming species like Emiliania huxleyi or Phaeocystis spp. The role of viruses infecting phytoplankton that do not form conspicuous blooms have received less attention. Here we explore the dynamics of phytoplankton and algal viruses over several sequential seasons, with a focus on the ubiquitous and diverse phytoplankton division Haptophyta, and their double-stranded DNA viruses, potentially with the capacity to infect the haptophytes. Viral and phytoplankton abundance and diversity showed recurrent seasonal changes, mainly explained by hydrographic conditions. By 454 tag-sequencing we revealed 93 unique haptophyte operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with seasonal changes in abundance. Sixty-one unique viral OTUs, representing Megaviridae and Phycodnaviridae, showed only distant relationship with currently isolated algal viruses. Haptophyte and virus community composition and diversity varied substantially throughout the year, but in an uncoordinated manner. A minority of the viral OTUs were highly abundant at specific time-points, indicating a boom-bust relationship with their host. Most of the viral OTUs were very persistent, which may represent viruses that coexist with their hosts, or able to exploit several host species.

AB Over a hundred species of aquatic birds overwinter in Central America's wetlands, providing opportunities for the transmission of influenza A viruses (IAVs). To date, limited IAV surveillance in Central America hinders our understanding of the evolution and ecology of IAVs in migratory hosts within the Western Hemisphere. To address this gap, we sequenced the genomes of 68 virus isolates obtained from ducks overwintering along Guatemala's Pacific Coast during 2010 to 2013. High genetic diversity was observed, including 9 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes, 7 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes, and multiple avian IAV lineages that have been detected at low levels (<1%) in North America. An unusually large number of viruses with the rare H14 subtype were identified (n = 14) over two consecutive seasons, the highest number of H14 viruses ever reported in a single location, providing evidence for a possible H14 source population located outside routinely sampled regions of North America. Viruses from Guatemala were positioned within minor clades divergent from the main North American lineage on phylogenies inferred for the H3, H4, N2, N8, PA, NP, and NS segments. A time-scaled phylogeny indicates that a Eurasian virus PA segment introduced into the Americas in the early 2000s disseminated to Guatemala during similar to 2007.1 to 2010.4 (95% highest posterior density [HPD]). Overall, the diversity detected in Guatemala in overwintering ducks highlights the potential role of Central America in the evolution of diverse IAV lineages in the Americas, including divergent variants rarely detected in the United States, and the importance of increasing IAV surveillance throughout Central America.
   IMPORTANCE Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic H7N3, H5Nx, and H7N8 avian influenza viruses in North America were introduced by migratory birds, underscoring the importance of understanding how wild birds contribute to the dissemination and evolution of IAVs in nature. At least four of the main IAV duck host species in North America migrate through or overwinter within a narrow strip of Central America, providing opportunities for diverse IAV lineages to mix and exchange gene segments. By obtaining whole-genome sequences of 68 IAV isolates collected from migratory waterfowl in Guatemala (2010 to 2013), the largest data set available from Central America to date, we detected extensive viral diversity, including gene variants rarely found in North America and gene segments of Eurasian origin. Our findings highlight the need for increased IAV surveillance across the geographical span of bird migration flyways, including Neotropical regions that have been vastly undersampled to date.

AB Viruses play a crucial role in the marine environment, promoting nutrient recycling and biogeochemical cycling and driving evolutionary processes. Tiny marine phytoplankton called prasinophytes are ubiquitous and significant contributors to global primary production and biomass. A number of viruses (known as prasinoviruses) that infect these important primary producers have been isolated and characterised over the past decade. Here we review the current body of knowledge about prasinoviruses and their interactions with their algal hosts. Several genes, including those encoding for glycosyltransferases, methyltransferases and amino acid synthesis enzymes, which have never been identified in viruses of eukaryotes previously, have been detected in prasinovirus genomes. The host organisms are also intriguing; most recently, an immunity chromosome used by a prasinophyte in response to viral infection was discovered. In light of such recent, novel discoveries, we discuss why the cellular simplicity of prasinophytes makes for appealing model host organism-virus systems to facilitate focused and detailed investigations into the dynamics of marine viruses and their intimate associations with host species. We encourage the adoption of the prasinophyte Ostreococcus and its associated viruses as a model host-virus system for examination of cellular and molecular processes in the marine environment.

AB Solar salterns are excellent model ecosystems for studying virus-microbial interactions because of their low microbial diversity, environmental stability, and high viral density. By using the power of CRISPR, spacers to link viruses to their prokaryotic hosts, we. explored virus-host interactions in geographically diverse salterns. Using taxonomic profiling, we identified hosts such as archaeal Haloquadratum, Halorubrum, and Haloarcula and bacterial Salinibacter, and we found that community composition related to not only salinity but also local environmental dynamics. Characterizing glycerol metabolism genes in these metagenomes suggested Halorubrum and Haloquadratum possess most dihydroxyacetone kinase genes while Salinibacter possesses most glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes. Using two different methods, we detected fewer CRISPR spacers in Haloquadratum-dominated compared with Halobacteriaceae-dominated saltern metagenomes. After CRISPR detection, spacers were aligned against haloviral genomes to map virus to host. While most alignments for each saltern metagenome linked viruses to Haloquadraturn walsbyi, there were also alignments indicating interactions with the low abundance taxa Haloarcula and Haloferax. Further examination of the dinucleotide and trinucleotide usage differences between paired viruses and their hosts confirmed viruses and hosts had similar nucleotide usage signatures. Detection of cas genes in the salterns supported the Possibility of CRISPR activity. Taken together, our studies suggest similar virus-host interactions exist in different solar salterns and that the glycerol metabolism gene dihydroxyacetone kinase s associated with Haloquadratum and Halorubrum.

AB Cyanophages, that is, viruses infecting cyanobacteria, are a key component driving cyanobacterial community dynamics both ecologically and evolutionarily. In addition to reducing biomass and influencing the genetic diversity of their host populations, they can also have a wider community-level impact due to the release of nutrients by phage-induced cell lysis. In this study, we isolated and characterized a new cyanophage, a siphophage designated as vB_NpeS-2AV2, capable of infecting the filamentous nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium Nodularia sp. AV2 with a lytic cycle between 12 and 18 hours. The role of the phage in the ecology of its host Nodularia and competitor Synechococcus was investigated in a set of microcosm experiments. Initially, phage-induced cell lysis decreased the number of Nodularia cells in the cultures. However, around 18%-27% of the population was resistant against the phage infection. Nitrogen was released from the Nodularia cells as a consequence of phage activity, resulting in a seven-fold increase in Synechococcus cell density. In conclusion, the presence of the cyanophage vB_NpeS-2AV2 altered the ecological dynamics in the cyanobacterial community and induced evolutionary changes in the Nodularia population, causing the evolution from a population dominated by susceptible cells to a population dominated by resistant ones.

AB Bacteriophages (phages) are widely distributed in the biosphere and play a key role in modulating microbial ecology in the soil, ocean, and humans. Although the role of DNA bacteriophages is well described, the biology of RNA bacteriophages is poorly understood. More than 1900 phage genomes are currently deposited in NCBI, but only 6 dsRNA bacteriophages and 12 ssRNA bacteriophages genome sequences are reported. The 6 dsRNA bacteriophages were isolated from legume samples or lakes with Pseudomonas syringae as the host. Here, we report the first Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage phiYY with a three- segmented dsRNA genome. phiYY was isolated from hospital sewage in China with the clinical P. aeruginosa strain, PAO38, as a host. Moreover, the dsRNA phage phiYY has a broad host range, which infects 99 out of 233 clinical P. aeruginosa strains isolated from four provinces in China. This work presented a detailed characterization of the dsRNA bacteriophage infecting P. aeruginosa.

AB Avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance in Antarctica during 2013 revealed the prevalence of evolutionarily distinct influenza viruses of the H11N2 subtype in Adelie penguins. Here we present results from the continued surveillance of AIV on the Antarctic Peninsula during 2014 and 2015. In addition to the continued detection of H11 subtype viruses in a snowy sheathbill during 2014, we isolated a novel H5N5 subtype virus from a chinstrap penguin during 2015. Gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the H11 virus detected in 2014 had a >99.1% nucleotide similarity to the H11N2 viruses isolated in 2013, suggesting the continued prevalence of this virus in Antarctica over multiple years. However, phylogenetic analysis of the H5N5 virus showed that the genome segments were recently introduced to the continent, except for the NP gene, which was similar to that in the endemic H11N2 viruses. Our analysis indicates geographically diverse origins for the H5N5 virus genes, with the majority of its genome segments derived from North American lineage viruses but the neuraminidase gene derived from a Eurasian lineage virus. In summary, we show the persistence of AIV lineages in Antarctica over multiple years, the recent introduction of gene segments from diverse regions, and reassortment between different AIV lineages in Antarctica, which together significantly increase our understanding of AIV ecology in this fragile and pristine environment.

AB In an genomics course sponsored by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), undergraduate students have isolated and sequenced the genomes of more than 1,150 mycobacteriophages, creating the largest database of sequenced bacteriophages able to infect a single host, Mycobacterium smegmatis, a soil bacterium. Genomic analysis indicates that these mycobacteriophages can be grouped into 26 clusters based on genetic similarity. These clusters span a continuum of genetic diversity, with extensive genomic mosaicism among phages in different clusters. However, little is known regarding the primary hosts of these mycobacteriophages in their natural habitats, nor of their broader host ranges. As such, it is possible that the primary host of many newly isolated mycobacteriophages is not M. smegmatis, but instead a range of closely related bacterial species. However, determining mycobacteriophage host range presents difficulties associated with mycobacterial cultivability, pathogenicity and growth. Another way to gain insight into mycobacteriophage host range and ecology is through bioinformatic analysis of their genomic sequences. To this end, we examined the correlations between the codon usage biases of 199 different mycobacteriophages and those of several fully sequenced mycobacterial species in order to gain insight into the natural host range of these mycobacteriophages. We find that UPGMA clustering tends to match, but not consistently, clustering by shared nucleotide sequence identify. In addition, analysis of GC content, tRNA usage and correlations between mycobacteriophage and mycobacterial codon usage bias suggests that the preferred host of many clustered mycobacteriophages is not M. smegmatis but other, as yet unknown, members of the mycobacteria complex or closely allied bacterial species.

AB Qinghai Lake is a major migrating bird breeding site that has experienced several recent highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) epizootics. From 2006 to 2009 we studied Qinghai's wild birds and pikas for evidence of AIV infections. We sampled 941 healthy wild animals and isolated seventeen H7N2 viruses (eight from pikas and nine from wild birds). The H7N2 viruses were phylogenetically closely related to each other and to viruses isolated in Hong Kong in the 1970s. We determined the pathogenicity of the H7N2 viruses by infecting chickens and mice. Our results suggest that pikas might play an important role in the ecology of AIVs, acting as intermediate hosts in which viruses become more adapted to mammals. Our findings of AI infection in pikas are consistent with previous observations and raise the possibility that pikas might play a previously unrecognized role in the ecology of AIVs peridomestic aquatic environments.

AB Asymptomatic Salmonella carriage in beef cattle is a food safety concern, and the beef feedlot environment may function as a reservoir of this pathogen. The goal of this study was to identify and isolate Salmonella and Salmonella bacteriophages from beef cattle feedlot environments in order to better understand the microbial ecology of Salmonella and identify phages that might be useful as anti-Salmonella beef safety interventions. Three feedlots in south Texas were visited, and 27 distinct samples from each source were collected from dropped feces, feed from feed bunks, drinking water from troughs, and soil in cattle pens (n = 108 samples). Preenrichment, selective enrichment, and selective/differential isolation of Salmonella were performed on each sample. A representative subset of presumptive Salmonella isolates was prepared for biochemical identification and serotyping. Samples were pooled by feedlot and sample type to create 36 samples and enriched to recover phages. Recovered phages were tested for host range against two panels of Salmonella hosts. Salmonella bacteria were identified in 20 (18.5%) of 108 samples by biochemical and/or serological testing. The serovars recovered included Salmonella enterica serovars Anatum, Muenchen, Altona, Kralingen, Kentucky, and Montevideo; Salmonella Anatum was the most frequently recovered serotype. Phage-positive samples were distributed evenly over the three feedlots, suggesting that phage prevalence is not strongly correlated with the presence of culturable Salmonella. Phages were found more frequently in soil and feces than in feed and water samples. The recovery of bacteriophages in the Salmonella-free feedlot suggests that phages might play a role in suppressing the Salmonella population in a feedlot environment.

AB Fungi are an important component of the soil ecosystem. Mycoviruses have numerous potential impacts on soil fungi, including phytopathogenic fungal species. However, the diversity and ecology of mycoviruses in soil fungi is largely unexplored. Our previous work has shown that the soil-borne phytopathogenic fungus Rosellinia necatrix was infected with several novel mycoviruses after growing for 2-3 years in an apple orchard. In this study, we investigated whether natural infection of R. necatrix with mycoviruses occurs under limited conditions. Virus-free R. necatrix isolates were grown in a small bucket containing soil samples for a short time (1.5-4.5 months) under greenhouse conditions. Screening of dsRNA mycoviruses among 365 retrieved isolates showed that four, including 6-31, 6-33, 6-35, and 7-11, harbored virus-like dsRNAs. Molecular characterization of the dsRNAs revealed that three retrieved isolates, 6-31, 6-33, and 6-35 were infected with a novel endornavirus and isolate 7-11 is infected with a novel partitivirus belonging to the genus Alphapartitivirus. These novel mycoviruses had no overt biological impact on R. necatrix. Overall, this study indicates that natural infections of R. necatrix with new mycoviruses can occur under experimental soil conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new group of viruses carrying naturally chimeric single-stranded (ss) DNA genomes that encompass genes derived from eukaryotic ssRNA and ssDNA viruses has been recently identified by metagenomic studies. The host range, genomic diversity, and abundance of these chimeric viruses, referred to as cruciviruses, remain largely unknown. In this article, we assembled and analyzed thirty-seven new crucivirus genomes from twelve peat viromes, representing twenty-four distinct genome organizations, and nearly tripling the number of available genomes for this group. All genomes possess the two characteristic genes encoding for the conserved capsid protein (CP) and a replication protein. Additional ORFs were conserved only in nearly identical genomes with no detectable similarity to known genes. Two cruciviruses possess putative introns in their replication-associated genes. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the replication proteins revealed intragene chimerism in at least eight chimeric genomes. This highlights the large extent of horizontal gene transfer and recombination events in the evolution of ssDNA viruses, as previously suggested. Read mapping analysis revealed that members of the 'Cruciviridae' group are particularly prevalent in peat viromes. Sequences matching the CP ranged from 0.6 up to 10.9 percent in the twelve peat viromes. In contrast, from sixty-nine available viromes derived from other environments, only twenty-four contained cruciviruses, which on average accounted for merely 0.2 percent of sequences. Overall, this study provides new genome information and insights into the diversity of chimeric viruses, a necessary first step in progressing toward an accurate quantification and host range identification of these new viruses.

AB Deep Lake in the Vestfold Hills is hypersaline and the coldest system in Antarctica known to support microbial growth (temperatures as low as -20 degrees C). It represents a strong experimental model because the lake supports a low-complexity community of haloarchaea, with the three most abundant species totaling similar to 72%. Moreover, the dominant haloarchaea are cultivatable, and their genomes are sequenced. Here we use metaproteomics linked to metagenome data and the genome sequences of the isolates to characterize the main pathways, trophic strategies, and interactions associated with resource utilization. The dominance of the most abundant member, Halohasta litchfieldiae, appears to be predicated on competitive utilization of substrates (e.g., starch, glycerol, and dihydroxyacetone) produced by Dunaliella, the lake's primary producer, while also possessing diverse mechanisms for acquiring nitrogen and phosphorus. The second most abundant member, strain DL31, is proficient in degrading complex proteinaceous matter. Hht. litchfieldiae and DL31 are inferred to release labile substrates that are utilized by Halorubrum lacusprofundi, the third most abundant haloarchaeon in Deep Lake. The study also linked genome variation to specific protein variants or distinct genetic capacities, thereby identifying strain-level variation indicative of specialization. Overall, metaproteomics revealed that rather than functional differences occurring at different lake depths or through size partitioning, the main lake genera possess major trophic distinctions, and phylotypes (e.g., strains of Hht. litchfieldiae) exhibit a more subtle level of specialization. This study highlights the extent to which the lake supports a relatively uniform distribution of taxa that collectively possess the genetic capacity to effectively exploit available nutrients throughout the lake.

AB Viruses are catalysts of biogeochemical cycling, architects of microbial community structure, and terminators of phytoplankton blooms. Viral lysis of diatoms, a key group of eukaryotic phytoplankton, has the potential to impact carbon export and marine food webs. However, the impact of viruses on diatom abundance and community composition is unknown. Diatom-virus dynamics were explored by sampling every month at two coastal and estuarine locations in Washington state, USA resulting in 41 new isolates of the pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia and 20 environmental virus samples. We conducted a total of 820 pair-wise crosses of the Pseudo-nitzschia isolates and viral communities. Viral communities infected Pseudo-nitzschia isolates in 8% of the crosses overall and 16% of crosses when the host and viral communities were isolated from the same sample. Isolates ranged in their permissivity to infection with some isolates not infected by any viral samples and others infected by up to 10 viral communities. Isolates that were infected by the most viral communities also had the highest maximum observed viral titers (as high as 16000 infectious units m1-1). Titers of the viral communities were host dependent, as titers for one viral sample on eight different hosts spanned four orders of magnitude. Sequencing of the Pseudonitzschla Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) of the revealed multiple subgroups of hosts with 100% ITS1 identities that were infected by different viral communities. Indeed, we repeatedly isolated groups of isolates with identical ITS1 sequences from the same water sample that displayed different viral infection phenotypes. The interactions between Pseudo-nitzschia and the viral communities highlight the diversity of diatoms and emphasize the complexity and variability of diatom-virus dynamics in the ocean.

AB Metagenomics has changed the face of virus discovery by enabling the accurate identification of viral genome sequences without requiring isolation of the viruses. As a result, metagenomic virus discovery leaves the first and most fundamental question about any novel virus unanswered: What host does the virus infect? The diversity of the global virosphere and the volumes of data obtained in metagenomic sequencing projects demand computational tools for virus-host prediction. We focus on bacteriophages (phages, viruses that infect bacteria), the most abundant and diverse group of viruses found in environmental metagenomes. By analyzing 820 phages with annotated hosts, we review and assess the predictive power of in silico phage-host signals. Sequence homology approaches are the most effective at identifying known phage-host pairs. Compositional and abundance-based methods contain significant signal for phage-host classification, providing opportunities for analyzing the unknowns in viral metagenomes. Together, these computational approaches further our knowledge of the interactions between phages and their hosts. Importantly, we find that all reviewed signals significantly link phages to their hosts, illustrating how current knowledge and insights about the interaction mechanisms and ecology of coevolving phages and bacteria can be exploited to predict phage-host relationships, with potential relevance for medical and industrial applications.New viruses infecting bacteria are increasingly being discovered in many environments through sequence-based explorations. To understand their role in microbial ecosystems, computational tools are indispensable to prioritize and guide experimental efforts. This review assesses and discusses a range of bioinformatic approaches to predict bacteriophage-host relationships when all that is known is their genome sequence.New viruses infecting bacteria are increasingly being discovered in many environments through sequence-based explorations.

AB In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the field of virus environmental ecology. In marine ecosystems, for example, viruses are now thought to play pivotal roles in the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and to be mediators of microbial evolution through horizontal gene transfer. The diversity and ecology of viruses in soils are poorly understood, but evidence supports the view that the diversity and ecology of viruses in soils differ substantially from those in aquatic systems. Desert biomes cover similar to 33% of global land masses, and yet the diversity and roles of viruses in these dominant ecosystems remain poorly understood. There is evidence that hot hyperarid desert soils are characterized by high levels of bacterial lysogens and low extracellular virus counts. In contrast, cold desert soils contain high extracellular virus titers. We suggest that the prevalence of microbial biofilms in hyperarid soils, combined with extreme thermal regimens, exerts strong selection pressures on both temperate and virulent viruses. Many desert soil virus sequences show low values of identity to virus genomes in public databases, suggesting the existence of distinct and as-yet-uncharacterized soil phylogenetic lineages (e.g., cyanophages). We strongly advocate for amplification-free metavirome analyses while encouraging the classical isolation of phages from dominant and culturable microbial isolates in order to populate sequence databases. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the study of viruses in hyperarid soils and of the factors that contribute to viral abundance and diversity in hot and cold deserts and offers technical recommendations for future studies.

AB The introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) into North America in 1999 is a classic example of viral emergence in a new environment, with its subsequent dispersion across the continent having a major impact on local bird populations. Despite the importance of this epizootic, the pattern, dynamics, and determinants of WNV spread in its natural hosts remain uncertain. In particular, it is unclear whether the virus encountered major barriers to transmission, or spread in an unconstrained manner, and if specific viral lineages were favored over others indicative of intrinsic differences in fitness. To address these key questions in WNV evolution and ecology, we sequenced the complete genomes of approximately 300 avian isolates sampled across the United States between 2001 and 2012. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a relatively star-like tree structure, indicative of explosive viral spread in the United States, although with some replacement of viral genotypes through time. These data are striking in that viral sequences exhibit relatively limited clustering according to geographic region, particularly for those viruses sampled from birds, and no strong phylogenetic association with well-sampled avian species. The genome sequence data analyzed here also contain relatively little evidence for adaptive evolution, particularly of structural proteins, suggesting that most viral lineages are of similar fitness and that WNV is well adapted to the ecology of mosquito vectors and diverse avian hosts in the United States. In sum, the molecular evolution of WNV in North America depicts a largely unfettered expansion within a permissive host and geographic population with little evidence of major adaptive barriers.
   IMPORTANCE
   How viruses spread in new host and geographic environments is central to understanding the emergence and evolution of novel infectious diseases and for predicting their likely impact. The emergence of the vector-borne West Nile virus (WNV) in North America in 1999 represents a classic example of this process. Using approximately 300 new viral genomes sampled from wild birds, we show that WNV experienced an explosive spread with little geographical or host constraints within birds and relatively low levels of adaptive evolution. From its introduction into the state of New York, WNV spread across the United States, reaching California and Florida within 4 years, a migration that is clearly reflected in our genomic sequence data, and with a general absence of distinct geographical clusters of bird viruses. However, some geographically distinct viral lineages were found to circulate in mosquitoes, likely reflecting their limited long-distance movement compared to avian species.

AB BackgroundAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) are found worldwide in numerous bird species, causing significant disease in gallinaceous poultry and occasionally other species. Surveillance of wild bird reservoirs provides an opportunity to add to the understanding of the epidemiology of AIVs.
   MethodsThis study examined key findings from the National Avian Influenza Wild Bird Surveillance Program over a 5-year period (July 2007-June 2012), the main source of information on AIVs circulating in Australia.
   ResultsThe overall proportion of birds that tested positive for influenza A via PCR was 1.90.1%, with evidence of widespread exposure of Australian wild birds to most low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) subtypes (H1-13, H16). LPAI H5 subtypes were found to be dominant and widespread during this 5-year period.
   ConclusionGiven Australia's isolation, both geographically and ecologically, it is important for Australia not to assume that the epidemiology of AIV from other geographic regions applies here. Despite all previous highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Australian poultry being attributed to H7 subtypes, widespread detection of H5 subtypes in wild birds may represent an ongoing risk to the Australian poultry industry.

AB Microorganisms and the viruses that infect them are the most numerous biological entities on Earth and enclose its greatest biodiversity and genetic reservoir. With strength in their numbers, these microscopic organisms are major players in the cycles of energy and matter that sustain all life. Scientists have only scratched the surface of this vast microbial world through culture-dependent methods. Recent developments in generating metagenomes, large random samples of nucleic acid sequences isolated directly from the environment, are providing comprehensive portraits of the composition, structure, and functioning of microbial communities. Moreover, advances in metagenomic analysis have created the possibility of obtaining complete or nearly complete genome sequences from uncultured microorganisms, providing important means to study their biology, ecology, and evolution. Here we review some of the recent developments in the field of metagenomics, focusing on the discovery of genetic novelty and on methods for obtaining uncultured genome sequences, including through the recycling of previously published datasets. Moreover we discuss how metagenomics has become a core scientific tool to characterize eco-evolutionary patterns of microbial ecosystems, thus allowing us to simultaneously discover new microbes and study their natural communities. We conclude by discussing general guidelines and challenges for modeling the interactions between uncultured microorganisms and viruses based on the information contained in their genome sequences. These models will significantly advance our understanding of the functioning of microbial ecosystems and the roles of microbes in the environment.

AB The development and use of entomopathogens as classical, conservation and augmentative biological control agents have included a number of successes and some setbacks in the past 15 years. In this forum paper we present current information on development, use and future directions of insect-specific viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes as components of integrated pest management strategies for control of arthropod pests of crops, forests, urban habitats, and insects of medical and veterinary importance.
   Insect pathogenic viruses are a fruitful source of microbial control agents (MCAs), particularly for the control of lepidopteran pests. Most research is focused on the baculoviruses, important pathogens of some globally important pests for which control has become difficult due to either pesticide resistance or pressure to reduce pesticide residues. Baculoviruses are accepted as safe, readily mass produced, highly pathogenic and easily formulated and applied control agents. New baculovirus products are appearing in many countries and gaining an increased market share. However, the absence of a practical in vitro mass production system, generally higher production costs, limited post application persistence, slow rate of kill and high host specificity currently contribute to restricted use in pest control. Overcoming these limitations are key research areas for which progress could open up use of insect viruses to much larger markets.
   A small number of entomopathogenic bacteria have been commercially developed for control of insect pests. These include several Bacillus thuringiensis sub-species, Lysinibacillus (Bacillus) sphaericus, Paenibacillus spp. and Serratia entomophila. B. thuringiensis sub-species kurstaki is the most widely used for control of pest insects of crops and forests, and B. thuringiensis sub-species israelensis and L. sphaericus are the primary pathogens used for control of medically important pests including dipteran vectors. These pathogens combine the advantages of chemical pesticides and MCAs: they are fast acting, easy to produce at a relatively low cost, easy to formulate, have a long shelf life and allow delivery using conventional application equipment and systemics (i.e. in transgenic plants). Unlike broad spectrum chemical pesticides, B. thuringiensis toxins are selective and negative environmental impact is very limited. Of the several commercially produced MCAs, B. thuringiensis (Bt) has more than 50% of market share. Extensive research, particularly on the molecular mode of action of Bt toxins, has been conducted over the past two decades. The Bt genes used in insect-resistant transgenic crops belong to the Cry and vegetative insecticidal protein families of toxins. Bt has been highly efficacious in pest management of corn and cotton, drastically reducing the amount of broad spectrum chemical insecticides used while being safe for consumers and non-target organisms. Despite successes, the adoption of Bt crops has not been without controversy. Although there is a lack of scientific evidence regarding their detrimental effects, this controversy has created the widespread perception in some quarters that Bt crops are dangerous for the environment. In addition to discovery of more efficacious isolates and toxins, an increase in the use of Bt products and transgenes will rely on innovations in formulation, better delivery systems and ultimately, wider public acceptance of transgenic plants expressing insect-specific Bt toxins.
   Fungi are ubiquitous natural entomopathogens that often cause epizootics in host insects and possess many desirable traits that favor their development as MCAs. Presently, commercialized microbial pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi largely occupy niche markets. A variety of molecular tools and technologies have recently allowed reclassification of numerous species based on phylogeny, as well as matching anamorphs (asexual forms) and teleomorphs (sexual forms) of several entomopathogenic taxa in the Phylum Ascomycota. Although these fungi have been traditionally regarded exclusively as pathogens of arthropods, recent studies have demonstrated that they occupy a great diversity of ecological niches. Entomopathogenic fungi are now known to be plant endophytes, plant disease antagonists, rhizosphere colonizers, and plant growth promoters. These newly understood attributes provide possibilities to use fungi in multiple roles. In addition to arthropod pest control, some fungal species could simultaneously suppress plant pathogens and plant parasitic nematodes as well as promote plant growth. A greater understanding of fungal ecology is needed to define their roles in nature and evaluate their limitations in biological control. More efficient mass production, formulation and delivery systems must be devised to supply an ever increasing market. More testing under field conditions is required to identify effects of biotic and abiotic factors on efficacy and persistence. Lastly, greater attention must be paid to their use within integrated pest management programs; in particular, strategies that incorporate fungi in combination with arthropod predators and parasitoids need to be defined to ensure compatibility and maximize efficacy.
   Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are potent MCAs. Substantial progress in research and application of EPNs has been made in the past decade. The number of target pests shown to be susceptible to EPNs has continued to increase. Advancements in this regard primarily have been made in soil habitats where EPNs are shielded from environmental extremes, but progress has also been made in use of nematodes in above-ground habitats owing to the development of improved protective formulations. Progress has also resulted from advancements in nematode production technology using both in vivo and in vitro systems; novel application methods such as distribution of infected host cadavers; and nematode strain improvement via enhancement and stabilization of beneficial traits. Innovative research has also yielded insights into the fundamentals of EPN biology including major advances in genomics, nematode-bacterial symbiont interactions, ecological relationships, and foraging behavior. Additional research is needed to leverage these basic findings toward direct improvements in microbial control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The bacterial genus Polaribacter is distributed widely in marine environments; however, there have been no reports of phages infecting Polaribacter strains. Here, we describe the isolation and genome sequencing of two lytic siphophages, P12002L and P12002S, that infect Polaribacter sp. strain IMCC12002. The two phages and host strain were isolated from coastal seawater of Korea. Complete genome sequences of the two phages were similar to each other and about 50 kb in length, with a G + C content of 28.9 %. The two genomes showed typical characteristics of phage genomes: a modular structure and high proportion of hypothetical proteins. The genome sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KR136259 (P12002L) and KR136260 (P12002S).

AB The genus Micromonas comprises distinct genetic clades that commonly dominate eukaryotic phytoplankton community from polar to tropical waters. This phytoplankter is also recurrently infected by abundant and genetically diverse prasinoviruses. Here we report on the interplay between prasinoviruses and Micromonas with regard to the genetic diversity of this host. For 1 year, we monitored the abundance of three clades of Micromonas and their viruses in the Western English Channel, both in the environment using clade-specific probes and flow cytometry, and in the laboratory using clonal strains of Micromonas clades to assay for their viruses by plaque-forming units. We showed that the seasonal fluctuations of Micromonas clades were closely mirrored by the abundance of their corresponding viruses, indicating that the members of Micromonas genus are susceptible to viral infection, regardless of their genetic affiliation. The characterization of 45 viral isolates revealed that Micromonas clades are attacked by specific virus populations, which exhibit distinctive clade specificity, life strategies and genetic diversity. However, some viruses can also cross-infect different host clades, suggesting a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer within the Micromonas genus. This study provides novel insights into the impact of viral infection for the ecology and evolution of the prominent phytoplankter Micromonas.

AB Antarctic ecosystems are dominated by micro-organisms, and viruses play particularly important roles in the food webs. Since the first report in 2009 (Lopez-Bueno etal. ), omic'-based studies have greatly enlightened our understanding of Antarctic aquatic microbial diversity and ecosystem function (Wilkins etal. ; Cavicchioli ). This has included the discovery of many new eukaryotic viruses (Lopez-Bueno etal. ), virophage predators of algal viruses (Yau etal. ), bacteria with resistance to phage (Lauro etal. ) and mechanisms of haloarchaeal evasion, defence and adaptation to viruses (Tschitschko etal. ). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Lopez-Bueno etal. () report the first discovery of RNA viruses from an Antarctic aquatic environment. High sequence coverage enabled genome variation to be assessed for four positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses from the order Picornavirales. By examining the populations present in the water column and in the lake's catchment area, populations of quasispecies' were able to be linked to local environmental factors. In view of the importance of viruses in Antarctic ecosystems but lack of data describing them, this study represents a significant advance in the field.

AB In China, several subtype avian influenza viruses consistently circulate in poultry. Numerous studies have focused on the evolution of the hemagglutinin gene; however, studies on the evolution of the matrix (M) gene are limited. In this study, a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of M gene sequences of avian influenza viruses isolated in China revealed that the M gene has evolved into six different lineages denoted as I-VI. The majority of lineages I and IV were isolated in terrestrial birds, while the majority of lineages II, III, V and VI were isolated in aquatic birds. Lineage I included 148 H9N2 subtype viruses (72.2%), lineage II comprised of 63 H6 subtype viruses (100%), and lineage IV included 157 H5 subtype viruses (97.5%). The mean substitution rates of different lineages ranged from 1.32 x 10 (3) (lineage III) to 3.64 x 10 (3) (lineage IV) substitutions per site per year. According to the most recent common ancestor of all lineages, lineage III was the oldest lineage, formed in 1981 or even earlier. And lineage V was the most recent, established around the year 2000. Selective pressure on M2 was stronger than that on M1. The strongest selection pressure was observed in lineage IV. In addition, site-by-site analyses of each lineage identified 8 positive selection sites, all in M2. Most of the sites (5 out of 8) were located in the extracellular domain, which is an antigen for vaccine development. The positive selection sites (amino acid positions 66, 82 and 97) are likely associated with virus budding. This study enhanced our knowledge of M gene evolution of avian influenza viruses, and is expected to improve the early detection of new viruses and lead to vaccine development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Numbering in excess of 10 million per milliliter of water, it is now undisputed that aquatic viruses are one of the major factors shaping the ecology and evolution of Earth's microbial world. Nonetheless, environmental viral diversity and roles remain poorly understood. Here we report the first thorough characterization of a virus (designated TsV) that infects the coastal marine microalga Tetraselmis striata. Unlike previously known microalgae-infecting viruses, TsV is a small (60 nm) DNA virus, with a 31 kb genome. From a range of eight different strains belonging to the Chlamydomonadaceae family, TsV was only able to infect T. striata. Gene expression dynamics revealed an up-regulation of viral transcripts already 1 h post-infection (p.i.). First clear signs of infection were observed 24 h p.i., with the appearance of viral factories inside the nucleus. TsV assembly was exclusively nuclear. TsV-N1 genome revealed very different from previously known algae viruses (Phycodnaviridae). Putative function and/or homology could be resolved for only 9 of the 33 ORFs encoded. Among those was a surprising DNA polymerase type Delta (only found in Eukaryotes), and two genes with closest homology to genes from human parasites of the urogenital tract. These results support the idea that the diversity of microalgae viruses goes far beyond the Phycodnaviridae family and leave the door open for future studies on implications of microalgae viruses for human health.

AB Influenza A viruses of the H1N1 subtype have emerged from the avian influenza gene pool in aquatic birds and caused human pandemics at least twice during the past century. Despite this fact, surprisingly little is known about the H1N1 gene pool in the aquatic bird reservoir. A preliminary study showed that an H1N1 virus from a shorebird of the Charadriiformes order was transmitted between animals through the airborne route of infection, whereas an H1N1 virus from a bird of the Anseriformes order was not. Here we show that two of the three H1N1 viruses isolated from Charadriiformes species in 2009 were transmitted between animals through the airborne route of infection, and five H1N1 isolates from Anseriformes species were not. The one H1N1 virus from a Charadriiformes species that failed to transmit through the airborne route was a reassortant possessing multiple internal gene segments from Anseriformes species. The molecular differences between the airborne-transmissible and non-airborne-transmissible H1N1 viruses were multigenic, involving the selection of virus with human-like receptor-binding specificity (alpha 2-6 sialic acid) and multiple differences in the polymerase complex, mainly in the PB2, PB1-F2, and nonstructural genes.

AB Although rat feces are widely suspected to be a source of pathogenic bacteria, few investigators have studied fecal pathogens in rats. We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. in Norway and black rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rat-tus rattus, respectively) from an urban neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada, collected September 2011 August 2012. Colon content was cultured for E. coli and Salmonella spp. and screened for the seven most-common enteropathogenic Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) serotypes by PCR. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance and Salmonella isolates were sero typed. We detected E. coli in 397/633 (62.7%) urban rats. Forty-one of 397(6.5%) E. coli isolates were resistant to >= 1 antimicrobial while 17 (4.3%) were multidrug resistant (including two isolates demonstrating extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance). Ten of 633 (1.6%) urban rats were carrying STEC serotypes including O145, O103, O26, and O45. Norway rats were more likely to be carrying E. coli compared to black rats, and there was geographic clustering of specific resistance patterns and STEC serotypes. Salmonella spp. were detected in 3/633 (0.5%) rats including serotypes Derby, Indiana, and Enteritidis. In contrast to zoonotic pathogens for which rats are the natural reservoir (e.g., Leptospira interrogans, Rickettsia typhi, Seoul virus), rats likely acquired E. coli and Salmonella spp. from their environment. The ability of rats to be a 'sponge' for environmental pathogens has received little consideration, and the ecology and public health significance of these organisms in rats requires further investigation.

AB Objective In March 2012, an H7N7 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) named A/wild goose/Dongting/PCO360/2012 (H7N7) (DT/PC0360) was recovered from a wild goose in East Dongting Lake. We performed whole-genome sequencing of the isolate, and analyzed the phylogenetic and molecular characterization.
   Methods RNA was extracted from environment samples (including fecal samples from wild bird or domestic ducks, and water samples) for detecting the presence of Influenza A Virus targeting Matrix gene, using realtime RT-PCR assay. The positive samples were performed virus isolation with embryonated eggs. The subtype of the isolates were identified by RT-PCR assay with the H1-H16 and N1-N9 primer set. The whole-genome sequencing of isolates were performed. Phylogenetic and molecular characterizations of the eight genes of the isolates were analyzed.
   Results Our results suggested that all the eight gene segments of DT/PCO360 belonged to the Eurasian gene pool, and the HA gene were belonged to distinct sublineage with H7N9 AIV which caused outbreaks in Mainland China in 2013. The hemagglutinin cleavage site of HA of DT/PCO360 showed characterization of low pathogenic avian influenza virus.
   Conclusion Strengthening the surveillance of AIVs of wild waterfowl and poultry in this region is vital for our knowledge of the ecology and mechanism of transmission to prevent an influenza pandemic.

AB Egypt is affected by serious human and animal mosquito-borne diseases such as Rift Valley fever (RVF). We investigated how potential RVF virus mosquito vector populations are affected by environmental conditions in the Nile Delta region of Egypt by collecting mosquitoes and environmental data from 3 key governorates before and after 2012 seasonal flooding. We found that environmental effects varied among species, life stages, pre- and postflood groupings, and geographic populations of the same species, and that mosquito community composition could change after flooding. Our study provides preliminary data for modeling mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases in the Nile Delta region.

AB Southeast Asia has been the breeding ground for many emerging diseases in the past decade, and it is in this region that new genetic variants of HPAI H5N1 viruses have been emerging. Cross-border movement of animals accelerates the spread of H5N1, and the changing environmental conditions also exert strong selective pressure on the viruses. The transboundary zoonotic diseases caused by H5N1 pose a serious and continual threat to global economy and public health. Here, we divided the H5N1 viruses isolated in Southeast Asia during 2003-2009 into four groups according to their phylogenetic relationships among HA gene sequences. Molecular evolution analysis suggests populations in expansion rather than a positive selection for group 2 and group 3, yet group 4 is under strong positive selection. Site 193 was found to be a potential glycosylation site and located in receptor-binding domain. Note that site 193 tends to appear in avian isolates instead of human strains. Population dynamics analysis reveals that the effective population size of infections in Southeast Asia has undergone three obvious increases, and the results are consistent with the epidemiological analysis. Ecological and phylogeographical analyses show that agro-ecological environments, migratory birds, domestic waterfowl, especially free-ranging ducks, are crucial in the occurrence, maintenance and spread of H5N1 virus. The epidemiological links between Indonesia and Suphanburi observed suggest that viruses in Indonesia were originated from multiple introductions.

AB Microviridae, a family of bacteria-infecting ssDNA viruses, is one of the still poorly characterized bacteriophage groups, even though it includes phage PhiX174, one of the main models in virology for genomic and capsid structure studies. Recent studies suggest that they are diverse and well represented in marine and freshwater virioplankton as well as in human microbiomes. However, their diversity, abundance, and ecological role are completely unknown in soil ecosystems. Here we present the comparative analysis of 17 completely assembled Microviridae genomes from 12 viromes of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland. Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved major capsid protein sequences revealed the affiliation to Gokushovirinae and Pichovirinae as well as to two newly defined subfamilies, the Aravirinae and Stokavirinae. Additionally, two new distinct prophages were identified in the genomes of Parabacteroides merdae and Parabacteroides distasonis representing a potential new subfamily of Microviridae. The differentiation of the subfamilies was confirmed by gene order and similarity analysis. Relative abundance analysis using the affiliation of the major capsid protein (VP1) revealed that Gokushovirinae, followed by Aravinnae, are the most abundant Microviridae in 11 out of 12 peat viromes. Sequences matching the Gokushovirinae and Aravirinae VP1 matching sequences, respectively, accounted for up to 4.19 and 0.65% of the total number of sequences in the corresponding virome, respectively. In this study we provide new genome information of Micro viridae and pave the way toward quantitative estimations of Microviridae subfamilies.

AB Viral diversity and virus-host interactions in oxygen-starved regions of the ocean, also known as oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), remain relatively unexplored. Microbial community metabolism in OMZs alters nutrient and energy flow through marine food webs, resulting in biological nitrogen loss and greenhouse gas production. Thus, viruses infecting OMZ microbes have the potential to modulate community metabolism with resulting feedback on ecosystem function. Here, we describe viral communities inhabiting oxic surface (10 m) and oxygen-starved basin (200 m) waters of Saanich Inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia using viral metagenomics and complete viral fosmid sequencing on samples collected between April 2007 and April 2010. Of 6459 open reading frames (ORFs) predicted across all 34 viral fosmids, 77.6% (n = 5010) had no homology to reference viral genomes. These fosmids recruited a higher proportion of viral metagenomic sequences from Saanich Inlet than from nearby northeastern subarctic Pacific Ocean (Line P) waters, indicating differences in the viral communities between coastal and open ocean locations. While functional annotations of fosmid ORFs were limited, recruitment to NCBI's non-redundant "nr" database and publicly available single-cell genomes identified putative viruses infecting marine thaumarchaeal and SUP05 proteobacteria to provide potential host linkages with relevance to coupled biogeochemical cycling processes in OMZ waters. Taken together, these results highlight the power of coupled analyses of multiple sequence data types, such as viral metagenomic and fosmid sequence data with prokaryotic single cell genomes, to chart viral diversity, elucidate genomic and ecological contexts for previously unclassifiable viral sequences, and identify novel host interactions in natural and engineered ecosystems.

AB We investigated the endophytic fungal community associated with the Amazonian medicinal plant Carapa guianensis and its potential for providing bioactive compounds. A total of 162 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained and identified by molecular methods. These isolates were classified into 35 different taxa in the genera Aspergilllus, Beltrania, Botryosphaeria, Colletotrichum, Diaporthe, Endomelanconiopsis, Fusarium, Guignardia, Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Pilidiella, Trichoderma, and Xylaria. The most frequent colonisers recovered of C. guianensis were Colletotrichum sp. 1, Diaporthe cf. mayteni, and Pestalotiopsis sp. 1. The fungal community had a moderate richness but high diversity and evenness indices. Colletotrichum sp. and Pilidiella wangiensis displayed selective antibacterial activity; Diaporthe cf. mayteni and Endomelanconiopsis endophytica showed high activity against amastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi; and Colletrotrichum sp. Guignardia mangiferae, Pestalotiopsis sp., and Diaporthe melonis were able to inhibit yellow fever virus proliferation. Our results suggest that the plants living in the tropical forest, such as the Amazonian hotspot region, can live in symbiosis with hidden and underestimated rich communities of endophytic fungi, which deserve protocols and/or specific laws to keep its future conservation. The capability of these endophytic fungi to produce bioactive compounds may be part of their chemical defense and adaptive response to survive and colonizing the plant host in wild environment. consequently, these fungal communities may provide a source of bioactive molecules, including those able to inhibit or control neglected tropical diseases.

AB The discovery of abundant viruses in the oceans and on land has ushered in a quarter century of groundbreaking advancements in our understanding of viruses within ecosystems. Two types of observations from environmental samples direct counts of viral particles and viral metagenomic sequences - have been critical to these discoveries. Accurate direct counts have established ecosystem-scale trends in the impacts of viral infection on microbial host populations and have shown that viral communities within aquatic and soil environments respond to both short term and seasonal environmental change. Direct counts have been critical for estimating viral production rate, a measurement essential to quantifying the implications of viral infection for the bio-geochemical cycling of nutrients within ecosystems. While direct counts have defined the magnitude of viral processes; shotgun sequences of environmental viral DNA - virome sequences - have enabled researchers to estimate the diversity and composition of natural viral communities. Virome-enabled studies have found the virioplankton to contain thousands of viral genotypes in communities where the most dominant viral population accounts for a small fraction of total abundance followed by a long tail of diverse populations. Detailed examination of long virome sequences has led to new understanding of genotype-to-phenotype connections within marine viruses and revealed that viruses carry metabolic genes that are important to maintaining cellular energy during viral replication. Increased access to long virome sequences will undoubtedly reveal more genetic secrets of viruses and enable us to build a genomics rulebook for predicting key biological and ecological features of unknown viruses.

AB Geobacter species may be important agents in the bioremediation of organic and metal contaminants in the subsurface, but as yet unknown factors limit the in situ growth of subsurface Geobacter well below rates predicted by analysis of gene expression or in silico metabolic modeling. Analysis of the genomes of five different Geobacter species recovered from contaminated subsurface sites indicated that each of the isolates had been infected with phage. Geobacter-associated phage sequences were also detected by metagenomic and proteomic analysis of samples from a uranium-contaminated aquifer undergoing in situ bioremediation, and phage particles were detected by microscopic analysis in groundwater collected from sediment enrichment cultures. Transcript abundance for genes from the Geobacter-associated phage structural proteins, tail tube Gp19 and baseplate J, increased in the groundwater in response to the growth of Geobacter species when acetate was added, and then declined as the number of Geobacter decreased. Western blot analysis of a Geobacter-associated tail tube protein Gp19 in the groundwater demonstrated that its abundance tracked with the abundance of Geobacter species. These results suggest that the enhanced growth of Geobacter species in the subsurface associated with in situ uranium bioremediation increased the abundance and activity of Geobacter-associated phage and show that future studies should focus on how these phages might be influencing the ecology of this site.

AB Viral infection of phytoplankton has major implications for biochemical and energy cycles, community dynamics, and microbial evolution in the marine environment. The non-bloom forming picoplankter Micromonas pusilla, a significant component of the plankton community worldwide, is known to be susceptible to infection by both dsDNA and dsRNA viruses. Logically, comprehensive knowledge of the ecology of M. pusilla requires a better understanding of the diversity and infection mechanisms of their viruses. Here, we investigated 19 new M. pusilla-specific viruses (MpVs) isolated from different locations and years. We performed partial characterization of those MpVs including structural characteristics, genome size, phylogenetic analysis based on partial DNA polymerase gene sequences, host range, and stability at different temperatures and upon exposure to chloroform. Combined, these characteristics allowed classification of the MpVs into 2 groups. Exposure to chloroform led to loss of infectivity by all MpVs in one group, which suggests the presence of an outer lipid envelope. In addition, all except one of the members in that group formed a monophylogenetic clade that was distinct from all other MpV isolates. The distinctive characteristics of the 2 MpV groups suggest different infection strategies, which may have important implications for the ecology of both host and virus populations in the environment. Knowledge gained from our study adds value to the MpV isolates as a scientific resource as it will aid in developing and testing in the laboratory new hypotheses about the ecological and biogeochemical implications of M. pusilla viral infection in the environment.

AB Halococcus hamelinensis was the first archaeon isolated from stromatolites. These geomicrobial ecosystems are thought to be some of the earliest known on Earth, yet, despite their evolutionary significance, the role of Archaea in these systems is still not well understood. Detailed here is the genome sequencing and analysis of an archaeon isolated from stromatolites. The genome of Halococcus hamelinensis consisted of 3,133,046 base pairs with an average G+C content of 60.08% and contained 3,150 predicted coding sequences or ORFs, 2,196 (68.67%) of which were protein-coding genes with functional assignments and 954 (29.83%) of which were of unknown function. Codon usage of the Halococcus hamelinensis genome was consistent with a highly acidic proteome, a major adaptive mechanism towards high salinity. Amino acid transport and metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, ribosomal structure, and unknown function COG genes were overrepresented. The genome of Halococcus hamelinensis also revealed characteristics reflecting its survival in its extreme environment, including putative genes/pathways involved in osmoprotection, oxidative stress response, and UV damage repair. Finally, genome analyses indicated the presence of putative transposases as well as positive matches of genes of Halococcus hamelinensis against various genomes of Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses, suggesting the potential for horizontal gene transfer.

AB The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the smallest and most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. In this Review, we summarize our understanding of the diversity of this remarkable phototroph and describe its role in ocean ecosystems. We discuss the importance of interactions of Prochlorococcus with the physical environment, with phages and with heterotrophs in shaping the ecology and evolution of this group. In light of recent studies, we have come to view Prochlorococcus as a 'federation' of diverse cells that sustains its broad distribution, stability and abundance in the oceans via extensive genomic and phenotypic diversity. Thus, it is proving to be a useful model system for elucidating the forces that shape microbial populations and ecosystems.

AB Viruses in the order Picomavirales infect eukaryotes, and are widely distributed in coastal waters. Amplicon deep-sequencing of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) revealed diverse and highly uneven communities of picorna-like viruses in the coastal waters of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Almost 300 000 pyrosequence reads revealed 145 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 95% sequence similarity at the amino-acid level. Each sample had between 24 and 71 OTUs and there was little overlap among samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that some clades of OTUs were only found at one site; whereas, other clades included OTUs from all sites. Since most of these OTUs are likely from viruses that infect eukaryotic phytoplankton, and viral isolates infecting phytoplankton are strain-specific; each OTU probably arose from the lysis of a specific phytoplankton taxon. Moreover, the patchiness in OTU distribution, and the high turnover of viruses in the mixed layer, implies continuous infection and lysis by RNA viruses of a diverse array of eukaryotic phytoplankton taxa. Hence, these viruses are likely important elements structuring the phytoplankton community, and play a significant role in nutrient cycling and energy transfer.

AB Background: Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems confer resistance to viral infection and thus mediate bacteria-phage interactions. However, the distribution and functional diversity of CRISPRs among environmental bacteria remains largely unknown. Here, comparative genomics of 75 Salinispora strains provided insight into the diversity and distribution of CRISPR-Cas systems in a cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus.
   Results: CRISPRs were found in all Salinispora strains, with the majority containing multiple loci and different Cas array subtypes. Of the six subtypes identified, three have not been previously described. A lower prophage frequency in S. arenicola was associated with a higher fraction of spacers matching Salinispora prophages compared to S. tropica, suggesting differing defensive capacities between Salinispora species. The occurrence of related prophages in strains from distant locations, as well as spacers matching those prophages inserted throughout spacer arrays, indicate recurring encounters with widely distributed phages over time. Linkages of CRISPR features with Salinispora microdiversity pointed to subclade-specific contacts with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This included lineage-specific spacer deletions or insertions, which may reflect weak selective pressures to maintain immunity or distinct temporal interactions with MGEs, respectively. Biogeographic patterns in spacer and prophage distributions support the concept that Salinispora spp. encounter localized MGEs. Moreover, the presence of spacers matching housekeeping genes suggests that CRISPRs may have functions outside of viral defense.
   Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive examination of CRISPR-Cas systems in a broadly distributed group of environmental bacteria. The ubiquity and diversity of CRISPRs in Salinispora suggests that CRISPR-mediated interactions with MGEs represent a major force in the ecology and evolution of this cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus.

AB Megaviruses are generically defined as giant viruses with genomes up to 126 Mb that infect eukaryotic unicellular protists; they are clearly delineated in DNA polymerase B phylogenetic trees; in addition, common features often include an associated virophage observed during infection; the presence of an amino acyl tRNA synthetase gene; and a nucleic acid mismatch repair protein, MutS gene. The archetypal representative of this evolving putative family is Mimivirus, an opportunistic pathogen of Acanthamoeba spp. originally thought to be a bacterium until its genome sequence was published in 2004. Subsequent analysis of marine metagenomic data revealed Megaviruses are likely ubiquitous on the surface ocean. Analysis of genome sequences of giant viruses isolated from naturally occurring marine protists such as microalgae and a microflagellate grazer, started the expansion of the Megaviridae. Here, we explored the possibility of developing Megavirus specific markers for mutS that could be used in virus molecular ecology studies. MutS is split into 15 different clades representing a wide range of cellular life, and two that contain Megaviruses, clade MutS7 and clade MutS8. We developed specific PCR primers that recognized Megavirus clade MutS8, a clade that we propose discriminates most of the algal Megaviruses. Analysis of seawater off the coast of Maine, US, revealed novel groups of algal Megaviruses that were present in all samples tested. The Megavirus clade MutS8 marker should be considered as a tool to reveal new diversity and distribution of this enigmatic group of viruses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Microbes and their viruses drive myriad processes across ecosystems ranging from oceans and soils to bioreactors and humans(1-4). Despite this importance, microbial diversity is only now being mapped at scales relevant to nature(5), while the viral diversity associated with any particular host remains little researched. Here we quantify host-associated viral diversity using viral-tagged metagenomics, which links viruses to specific host cells for high-throughput screening and sequencing. In a single experiment, we screened 10(7) Pacific Ocean viruses against a single strain of Synechococcus and found that naturally occurring cyanophage genome sequence space is statistically clustered into discrete populations. These population-based, host-linked viral ecological data suggest that, for this single host and seawater sample alone, there are at least 26 double-stranded DNA viral populations with estimated relative abundances ranging from 0.06 to 18.2%. These populations include previously cultivated cyanophage and new viral types missed by decades of isolate-based studies. Nucleotide identities of homologous genes mostly varied by less than 1% within populations, even in hypervariable genome regions, and by 42-71% between populations, which provides benchmarks for viral metagenomics and genome-based viral species definitions. Together these findings showcase a new approach to viral ecology that quantitatively links objectively defined environmental viral populations, and their genomes, to their hosts.

AB Environmental disturbances such as deforestation, urbanization or pollution have been widely acknowledged to play a key role in the emergence of many infectious diseases, including mosquito-borne viruses. However, we have little understanding of how habitat isolation affects the communities containing disease vectors. Here, we test the effects of habitat type and isolation on the colonization rates, species richness and abundances of mosquitoes and their aquatic predators in water-filled containers in northwestern Thailand. For eight weeks water-filled containers were monitored in areas containing forest, urban and agricultural habitats and mixtures of these three. Mosquito larvae of the genera Aedes and Culex appeared to be differentially affected by the presence of the dominant predator; Toxorhynchites splendens (Culicidae). Therefore, a predation experiment was conducted to determine predator response to prey density and its relative effects on different mosquito prey populations. Colonization rates, species richness and abundances of mosquito predators were strongly related to forest habitat and to the distance from other aquatic habitats. Areas with more tree cover had higher predator species richness and abundance in containers. Containers that were close to surface water were more rapidly colonized than those further away. In all habitat types, including urban areas, when predators were present, the number of mosquito larvae was much tower. Containers in urban areas closer to water-bodies, or with more canopy cover, had higher predator colonization rates and species richness. T spiendens (Culicidae) preyed on the larvae of two mosquito genera at different rates, which appeared to be related to prey behaviour. This study shows that anthropogenic landscape modification has an important effect on the natural biological control of mosquitoes. Vector control programmes and urban planning should attempt to integrate ecological theory when developing strategies to reduce mosquito populations. This would result in management strategies that are beneficial for both public health and biodiversity. (C) 2014 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved

AB Viruses modulate microbial communities and alter ecosystem functions. However, due to cultivation bottlenecks specific virus-host interaction dynamics remain cryptic. Here we examined 127 single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) from uncultivated SUP05 bacteria isolated from a marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) to identify 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae. Infection frequencies suggest that similar to 1/3 of SUP05 bacteria are viral-infected, with higher infection frequency where oxygen-deficiency was most severe. Observed Microviridae clonality suggests recovery of bloom-terminating viruses, while systematic co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses posits previously unrecognized cooperation modes. Analyses of 186 microbial and viral metagenomes revealed that SUP05 viruses persisted for years, but remained endemic to the OMZ. Finally, identification of virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase suggests SUP05 viruses reprogram their host's energy metabolism. Together these results demonstrate closely coupled SUP05 virus-host co-evolutionary dynamics with potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs.

TI Salmonella phages isolated from dairy farms in Thailand show wider host

AB Salmonella is a zoonotic pathogen with globally distributed serovars as well as serovars predominantly found in certain regions; for example, serovar Weltevreden is rarely isolated in the U.S., but is common in Thailand. Relative to our understanding of Salmonella diversity, our understanding of the global diversity of Salmonella phages is limited. We hypothesized that the serovar diversity in a given environment and farming system will affect the Salmonella phage diversity associated with animal hosts. We thus isolated and characterized Salmonella phages from 15 small-scale dairy farms in Thailand and compared the host ranges of the 62 Salmonella phage isolates obtained with host range diversity for 129 phage isolates obtained from dairy farms in the U.S. The 62 phage isolates from Thailand represented genome sizes ranging from 40 to 200 kb and showed lysis of 6-25 of the 26 host strains tested (mean number of strain lysed = 19). By comparison, phage isolates previously obtained in a survey of 15 U.S. dairy farms showed a narrow host range (lysis of 1-17; mean number of strains lysed = 4); principal coordinate analysis also confirmed U.S. and Thai phages had distinct host lysis profiles. Our data indicate that dairy farms that differ in management practices and are located on different continents can yield phage isolates that differ in their host ranges, providing an avenue for isolation of phages with desirable host range characteristics for commercial applications. Farming systems characterized by coexistence of different animals may facilitate presence of Salmonella phages with wide host ranges. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A variety of microbially mediated metabolic pathways impact biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial subsurface environments. However, the role that viruses have in influencing microbial mortality and microbial community structure is poorly understood. Here we investigated the production of viruses and change in microbial community structure within shallow alluvial aquifer sediment slurries amended with C-13-labeled acetate and nitrate. Biostimulation resulted in production of viruses concurrent with acetate oxidation, (CO2)-C-13 production and nitrate reduction. Interestingly, change in viral abundance was positively correlated to acetate consumption (r(2) = 0.6252, P<0.05) and (CO2)-C-13 production (r(2) = 0.6572, P<0.05); whereas change in cell abundance was not correlated to acetate consumption or (CO2)-C-13 production. Viral-mediated cell lysis has implications for microbial community structure. Betaproteobacteria predominated microbial community composition (62% of paired-end reads) upon inoculation but decreased in relative abundance and was negatively correlated to changes in viral abundance (r(2) = 0.5036, P<0.05). As members of the Betaproteobacteria decreased, Gammaproteobacteria, specifically Pseudomonas spp., increased in relative abundance (82% of paired-end reads) and was positively correlated with the change in viral abundance (r(2) = 0.5368, P<0.05). A nitrate-reducing bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain Alda10, was isolated from these sediments and produced viral-like particles with a filamentous morphology that did not result in cell lysis. Together, these results indicate that viruses are linked to carbon biogeochemistry and community structure in terrestrial subsurface sediments. The subsequent cell lysis has the potential to alter available carbon pools in subsurface environments, additionally controlling microbial community structure from the bottom-up.

AB Background: Wild aquatic birds, reservoir of low-pathogenicity (LP) avian influenza viruses (AIVs), congregate in huge numbers in Western Siberia wetlands, where major intra- and inter-continental bird flyways overlap. In 2005 and 2006, highly pathogenic (HP) AIV H5N1 epizootics affected wild and domestic birds in the Novosibirsk Region. In 2012, we evaluated AIV persistence in Siberian natural and anthropic ecosystems.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In Novosibirsk Region, 166 wild birds ecologically linked to aquatic environments and 152 domestic waterfowl were examined for AIV isolation in embryonating chicken eggs. Biological samples were obtained by integrating the conventional cloacal swab collection with the harvesting of samples from birds' plumage. Haemagglutinating allantoic fluids were further characterized by serological and molecular methods. In August-September 2012, 17 AIVs, including three H3N8, eight H4N6, two H4N?, one H2N?, one H?N2, and two unsubtyped LPAIVs, were isolated from 15 wild ducks. Whereas comparable proportions of wild Anseriformes (n.118) tested virus isolation (VI)-positive from cloaca and feathers (5.9% vs 8.5%) were detected, the overall prevalence of virus isolation, obtained from both sampling methods, was 2.4 times higher than that calculated on results from cloacal swab examination only (14.4% vs 5.9%). Unlike previously described in this area, the H4N6 antigenic subtype was found to be the prevalent one in 2012. Both cloacal and feather samples collected from domestic waterfowl tested VI-negative.
   Conclusion/Significance: We found lack of evidence for the H5N1 HPAIV circulation, explainable by the poor environmental fitness of HPAIVs in natural ecosystems. Our LPAIV isolation data emphasise the importance of Siberia wetlands in influenza A virus ecology, providing evidence of changes in circulation dynamics of HN antigenic subtypes harboured in wild bird reservoirs. Further studies of isolates, based on bioinformatic approaches to virus molecular evolution and phylogenesis, will be needed to better elucidate mechanisms involved in AIV perpetuation in this area.

AB Influenza virus A/whale/Maine/328B/1984 (H13N2) was isolated from a diseased pilot whale.Since only a partial sequence was available, its complete genome was sequenced and compared to the sequences of subtype H13 influenza viruses from shorebirds and various influenza viruses of marine mammals.The data reveal a rare genotype constellation with all gene segments derived of an influenza virus adapted to gulls, terns and waders.In contrast, the phylogenetic trees indicate that the majority of influenza viruses isolated from marine mammals derived from influenza viruses adapted to geese and ducks.We conclude that A/whale/Maine/328B/1984 is the first record of an infection of a marine mammal from a gull-origin influenza virus.

AB Betanodaviruses are the causative agents of viral nervous necrosis and affect a broad range of fish species worldwide. Their bi-segmented genome is composed of the RNA1 and the RNA2 molecules encoding the viral polymerase and the coat protein, respectively. In southern Europe the presence of the RGNNV and the SJNNV genotypes, and the RGNNV/SJNNV and RGNNV/SJNNV reassortants has been documented. Several studies have reported a correlation between water temperature and disease onset. To explore the replication efficiency of betanodaviruses with different genomes in relation to temperature and to understand the role of genetic reassortment on viral phenotype, RGNNV, SJNNV, RGNNV/SJNNV and RGNNV/SJNNV field isolates were fully sequenced, and growth curves generated in vitro at four different temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 degrees C) were developed for each isolate. The data obtained, corroborated by statistical analysis, demonstrated that viral titres of diverse betanodavirus genotypes varied significantly in relation to the incubation temperature of the culture. In particular, at 30 degrees C betanodaviruses under investigation presented different phenotypes, and viruses containing the RNA1 of the RGNNV genotype showed the best replication efficiency. Laboratory results demonstrated that viruses clustering within the same genotype based on the polymerase gene, possess similar growth kinetics in response to temperature, thus highlighting the key role of RNA1 in controlling viral replication at different environmental conditions. The results generated might have practical implications for the inference of viral phenotype according to genetic features and may contribute to a better understanding of betanodavirus ecology.

AB The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes (Stegomya) albopictus is an invasive species that has spread across the world in the last two decades, showing a great capacity to adapt to contrasting climates and environments. While demonstrated in many insects, the contribution of bacterial symbionts in Aedes ecology is a challenging aspect that needs to be investigated. Also some bacterial species have already been identified in Ae. albopictus using classical methods, but a more accurate survey of mosquito-associated bacterial diversity is needed to decipher the potential biological functions of bacterial symbionts in mediating or constraining insect adaptation. We surveyed the bacteria associated with field populations of Ae. albopictus from Madagascar by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Different aspects of amplicon preparation and sequencing depth were tested to optimize the breadth of bacterial diversity identified. The results revealed that all mosquitoes collected from different sites have a bacterial microbiota dominated by a single taxon, Wolbachia pipientis, which accounted for about 99% of all 92,615 sequences obtained. As Ae. albopictus is known to harbor two Wolbachia strains (wAlbA and wAlbB), a quantitative PCR was used to estimate the relative densities, (i.e., the bacteria-to-host gene ratios) of each strains in individual mosquitoes. Relative densities were between 6.25 x 10(0.01) and 5.47 x 10(0.1) for wAlbA and between 2.03 x 10(0.1) and 1.4 x 10(1) for wAlbB. Apart from Wolbachia, a total of 31 bacterial taxa were identified at the genus level using different method variations. Diversity index values were low and probably underestimated the true diversity due to the high abundance of Wolbachia sequences vastly outnumbering sequences from other taxa. Further studies should implement alternative strategies to specifically discard from analysis any sequences from Wolbachia, the dominant endosymbiotic bacterium in Ae. albopictus from this area.

AB Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) represents a serious threat to inhabitants of endemic areas of North America. Despite successful clinical isolations of the fungal etiological agent, Coccidioides spp., the screening of environmental samples has had low effectiveness, mainly because of the poor characterization of Coccidioides ecological niche. We explored Valle de las Palmas, Baja California, Mexico, a highly endemic area near the U.S. Mexico border, where we previously detected Coccidioides via culture-independent molecular methods. By testing the serum from 40-trapped rodents with ELISA, we detected antibodies against Coccidioides in two species: Peromyscus maniculatus and Neotoma lepida. This study comprises the first report of wild rodent serum tested for coccidioidal antibodies, and sets the basis to analyze this pathogen in its natural environment and explore its potential ecological niche.

AB For a parasite evolving in a spatially structured environment, an evolutionarily advantageous strategy may be to reduce its transmission rate or infectivity. We demonstrate this empirically using bacteriophage (phage) from an evolution experiment where spatial structure was maintained over 550 phage generations on agar plates. We found that a single substitution in the major capsid protein led to slower adsorption of phage to host cells with no change in lysis time or burst size. Plaques formed by phage isolates containing this mutation were not only larger but also contained more phage per unit area. Using a spatially explicit, individual-based model, we showed that when there is a trade-off between adsorption and diffusion (i.e. less 'sticky' phage diffuse further), slow adsorption can maximize plaque size, plaque density and overall productivity. These findings suggest that less infective pathogens may have an advantage in spatially structured populations, even when well-mixed models predict that they will not.

AB Viral coat protein gene was detected in thirty isolates of different soil-borne fungi, using cotton leaf curl coat protein specific primers (geminiviruses). Out of them, seven fungal isolates showed positive results (a band with a molecular size of 680 bp). The products amplified from two isolates, Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. and Mucor racemosus Bull., were excised from the gel, purified and sequenced. The sequence analysis revealed that the amplicons were coat protein genes of geminivirus. The gene isolated from M phaseolina was similar to that of wheat dwarf geminivirus with identity not exceeding 36 %; and the coat protein isolated from M. racemosus was 43 % identical with the maize streak geminivirus. These low identities suggest that the amplification products belong to new records of geminiviruses designated (MpDV) and (MrDV), respectively. The isolate from M racemosus was selected to investigate the viral transmission into the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht. Some phenotypic changes were observed in the infected mycelia of F. oxysporum, including growth rate reduction and increased pigmentation. The infected mycelia of both fungi were subjected to electron microscopy examination and the results revealed that different virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed. This finding may help in understanding and using the ssDNA mycoviruses in fungal biocontrol and expands our knowledge of virus ecology and evolution.

AB The principal mode of avian influenza A virus (AIV) transmission among wild birds is thought to occur via an indirect fecal-oral route, whereby individuals are exposed to virus from the environment through contact with virus-contaminated water. AIV can remain viable for an extended time in water; however, little is known regarding the influence of the biotic community (i.e., aquatic invertebrates) on virus persistence and infectivity in aquatic environments. We conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the ability of an aquatic filter-feeding invertebrate, Daphnia magna, to accumulate virus from AIV-dosed water under the hypothesis that they represent a potential vector of AIV to waterfowl hosts. We placed live daphnids in test tubes dosed with low-pathogenicity AIV (H3N8 subtype isolated from a wild duck) and sampled Daphnia tissue and the surrounding water using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at 3-to 120-min intervals for up to 960 min following dosing. Concentrations of viral RNA averaged 3 times higher in Daphnia tissue than the surrounding water shortly after viral exposure, but concentrations decreased exponentially through time for both. Extracts from Daphnia tissue were negative for AIV by cell culture, whereas AIV remained viable in water without Daphnia present. Our results suggest daphnids can accumulate AIV RNA and effectively remove virus particles from water. Although concentrations of viral RNA were consistently higher in Daphnia tissue than the water, additional research is needed on the time scale of AIV inactivation after Daphnia ingestion to fully elucidate Daphnia's role as a potential vector of AIV infection to aquatic birds.

AB In aquatic birds, influenza A viruses mainly replicate in the intestinal tract without significantly affecting the health of the host, but in mammals, they replicate in the respiratory tract and often cause disease. Occasionally, influenza viruses have been detected in stool samples of hospitalized patients and in rectal swabs of naturally or experimentally infected mammals. In this study, we compared the biological and molecular differences among four wild-type avian H1N1 influenza viruses and their corresponding fecal and lung isolates in DBA/2J and BALB/cJ mice. All fecal and lung isolates were more pathogenic than the original wild-type viruses, when inoculated into mice of both strains. The increased virulence was associated with the acquisition of genetic mutations. Most of the novel genotypes emerged as PB2(E627K), HA(F128V), HA(F454L), or HA(H300P) variations, and double mutations frequently occurred in the same isolate. However, influenza virus strain-and host-specific differences were also observed in terms of selected variants. The avian H1N1 virus of shorebird origin appeared to be unique in its ability to rapidly adapt to BALB/cJ mice via the fecal route, compared to the adaptability of the H1N1 virus of mallard origin. Furthermore, a bimodal distribution in fecal shedding was observed in mice infected with the fecal isolates, while a normal distribution was observed after infection with the lung isolates or wild-type virus. Fecal isolates contained HA mutations that increased the activation pH of the HA protein. We conclude that influenza virus variants that emerge in fecal isolates in mammals might influence viral transmission, adaptation to mammals, and viral ecology or evolution.

AB Recent advances in metagenomics have generated numerous insights related to the cell biology, ecology, evolution, and biogeochemistry of microbial life in the ocean. Notably, advances in single cell genomics (SCG), fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) capture of specific populations and metagenomic assembly are providing valuable information related to within and between lineage genomic content. Improved reference genome databases have assisted biogeographic studies of particular taxa, including in some cases different ecotypes. Several studies targeting picoplankton, associated with various particle size classes, have begun to define contrasting trends in gene family evolution between free-living compared to particle associated microbes. Also viruses and eukaryotic microbes are increasingly considered in metagenomic studies and specific associations between viruses, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic microbes are emerging.

AB The abundance, genetic diversity, and crucial ecological and evolutionary roles of marine phages have prompted a large number of metagenomic studies. However, obtaining a thorough understanding of marine phages has been hampered by the low number of phage isolates infecting major bacterial groups other than cyanophages and pelagiphages. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for the isolation of phages that infect abundant marine bacterial groups. In this study, we isolated and characterized HMO-2011, a phage infecting a bacterium of the SAR116 clade, one of the most abundant marine bacterial lineages. HMO-2011, which infects "Candidatus Puniceispirillum marinum" strain IMCC1322, has an similar to 55-kb dsDNA genome that harbors many genes with novel features rarely found in cultured organisms, including genes encoding a DNA polymerase with a partial DnaJ central domain and an atypical methanesulfonate monooxygenase. Furthermore, homologs of nearly all HMO-2011 genes were predominantly found in marine metagenomes rather than cultured organisms, suggesting the novelty of HMO-2011 and the prevalence of this phage type in the oceans. A significant number of the viral metagenome sequences obtained from the ocean surface were best assigned to the HMO-2011 genome. The number of reads assigned to HMO-2011 accounted for 10.3%-25.3% of the total reads assigned to viruses in seven viromes from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, making the HMO-2011 genome the most or second-most frequently assigned viral genome. Given its ability to infect the abundant SAR116 clade and its widespread distribution, Puniceispirillum phage HMO-2011 could be an important resource for marine virus research.

AB Background: Salmonella is a widely distributed foodborne pathogen that causes tens of millions of salmonellosis cases globally every year. While the genomic diversity of Salmonella is increasingly well studied, our knowledge of Salmonella phage genomic diversity is still rather limited, despite the contributions of both lysogenic and lytic phages to Salmonella virulence, diversity and ecology (e.g., through horizontal gene transfer and Salmonella lysis). To gain a better understanding of phage diversity in a specific ecological niche, we sequenced 22 Salmonella phages isolated from a number of dairy farms from New York State (United States) and analyzed them using a comparative genomics approach.
   Results: Classification of the 22 phages according to the presence/absence of orthologous genes allowed for classification into 8 well supported clusters. In addition to two phage clusters that represent novel virulent Salmonella phages, we also identified four phage clusters that each contained previously characterized phages from multiple continents. Our analyses also identified two clusters of phages that carry putative virulence (e. g., adhesins) and antimicrobial resistance (tellurite and bicyclomycin) genes as well as virulent and temperate transducing phages. Insights into phage evolution from our analyses include (i) identification of DNA metabolism genes that may facilitate nucleotide synthesis in phages with a G+C % distinct from Salmonella, and (ii) evidence of Salmonella phage tailspike and fiber diversity due to both single nucleotide polymorphisms and major re-arrangements, which may affect the host specificity of Salmonella phages.
   Conclusions: Genomics-based characterization of 22 Salmonella phages isolated from dairy farms allowed for identification of a number of novel Salmonella phages. While the comparative genomics analyses of these phages provide a number of new insights in the evolution and diversity of Salmonella phages, they only represent a first glimpse into the diversity of Salmonella phages that is likely to be discovered when phages from different environments are characterized.

ID LARGE DNA VIRUSES; HIGHLIGHTS; VIROPHAGE; AMEBAS
AB Giant viruses of the Megavirales order have been recently isolated from aquatic environments and have long been neglected because they are removed from samples during viral purification for viral metagenomic studies. Due to bacterial overgrowth and susceptibility to high concentrations of antibiotics, isolation by amoeba co-culture has a low efficiency and is highly time-consuming. Thus, few environments have been exhaustively investigated to date, although the ubiquitous distribution of the Acanthamoeba sp. suggests that these viruses could also be ubiquitous. In this work, we have implemented a high-throughput method to detect amoebae lysis on agar plates that allows the testing of hundreds of samples in a few days. Using this procedure, a total of 11 new Marseilleviridae strains and four new Mimiviridae strains, including a virus infected with a virophage, were isolated from 1000 environmental samples from Tunisia. Of these, four corresponded to new genotypic variants. These isolates are the first African environmental isolates identified from these two families, and several samples were obtained from a hypersaline aquatic environment. These results demonstrate that this technique can be used for the evaluation and characterization of large collections of giant viruses to provide insight into understanding their ecology.

ID ECOLOGY; VIRUS
AB Coastal realignment is now widely instituted in the UK as part of local flood risk management plans to compensate for the loss of European protected habitat and to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise and coastal squeeze. Coastal aquatic habitats have long been known to provide suitable habitats for brackish-water mosquitoes and historically, coastal marshes were considered to support anopheline mosquito populations that were responsible for local malaria transmission. This study surveyed the eight largest managed realignment (MRA) sites in England (Essex and the Humber) for mosquito habitats. The apparent absence of anopheline mosquitoes exploiting aquatic habitats at all of these sites suggests that the risk of malaria associated with MRA sites is currently negligible. However, three of the eight sites supported populations of two nuisance and potential arboviral vector species, Aedes detritus and Aedes caspius. The aquatic habitats that supported mosquitoes resulted from a) specific design aspects of the new sea wall (ballast to mitigate wave action and constructed saline borrow ditches) that could be designed out or managed or b) isolated pools created through silt accretion or expansion of flooded zones to neighbouring pasture. The public health risks and recommendations for management are discussed in this report. This report highlights the need for pro-active public health impact assessments prior to MRA development in consultation with the Health Protection Agency, as well as the need for a case-by-case approach to design and management to mitigate mosquito or mosquito-borne disease issues now and in the future.

AB Aims To isolate and characterize a diversity of bacteriophages (phages) that infect the soilborne pathogen Rhodococcus equi. Methods and Results Twenty-seven phages were isolated from soil samples from geographically distinct locations using a range of R.equi bacterial strains, including clinical isolates. On the basis of host range, genomic DNA restriction profiles and virion protein profiles, the diversity of these phages was extensive, with phages being divided into 16 groupings. Conclusions Based on a range of criteria, these phages could be divided into 16 distinct groupings. The majority of the phages recovered from soil were Siphoviridae, adding to the limited number of Siphoviridae described to date for R.equi. One grouping consisted of phages belonging to the Myoviridae. Significance and Impact of the Study This represents the first study looking at the diversity of phages infecting the pathogen R.equi, including the first Myoviridae to be isolated and characterized for the genus Rhodococcus and for the nonmycobacterial actinomycetes. Given their diverse host range, including clinical isolates, this collection of phages offers the potential for the development of phage cocktails for use as a therapeutic or alternatively in the biocontrol of this pathogen in reservoirs of infection relating to animal husbandry.

AB Interspecies transmission of influenza A is an important factor in the evolution and ecology of influenza viruses. Marine mammals are in contact with a number of influenza reservoirs, including aquatic birds and humans, and this may facilitate transmission among avian and mammalian hosts. Virus isolation, whole genome sequencing, and hemagluttination inhibition assay confirmed that exposure to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus occurred among free-ranging Northern Elephant Seals (Mirounga angustirostris) in 2010. Nasal swabs were collected from 42 adult female seals in April 2010, just after the animals had returned to the central California coast from their short post-breeding migration in the northeast Pacific. Swabs from two seals tested positive by RT-PCR for the matrix gene, and virus was isolated from each by inoculation into embryonic chicken eggs. Whole genome sequencing revealed greater than 99% homology with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) that emerged in humans from swine in 2009. Analysis of more than 300 serum samples showed that samples collected early in 2010 (n = 100) were negative and by April animals began to test positive for antibodies against the pH1N1 virus (HI titer of >= 1:40), supporting the molecular findings. In vitro characterizations studies revealed that viral replication was indistinguishable from that of reference strains of pH1N1 in canine kidney cells, but replication was inefficient in human epithelial respiratory cells, indicating these isolates may be elephant seal adapted viruses. Thus findings confirmed that exposure to pandemic H1N1 that was circulating in people in 2009 occurred among free-ranging Northern Elephant Seals in 2010 off the central California coast. This is the first report of pH1N1 (A/Elephant seal/California/1/2010) in any marine mammal and provides evidence for cross species transmission of influenza viruses in free-ranging wildlife and movement of influenza viruses between humans and wildlife.

AB Whole genome amplification and sequencing of single microbial cells enables genomic characterization without the need of cultivation(1-3). Viruses, which are ubiquitous and the most numerous entities on our planet(4) and important in all environments(5), have yet to be revealed via similar approaches. Here we describe an approach for isolating and characterizing the genomes of single virions called 'Single Virus Genomics' (SVG). SVG utilizes flow cytometry to isolate individual viruses and whole genome amplification to obtain high molecular weight genomic DNA (gDNA) that can be used in subsequent sequencing reactions.

AB Background: Wild aquatic birds constitute the natural reservoir for avian influenza viruses (AIVs). Separate Eurasian and American AIV gene pools exist. Here, the prevalence and diversity of AIVs in gulls and dabbling ducks in Norway were described. The influence of host species and temporal changes on AIV prevalence was examined. Five AIVs from Norway, including three from common gull (Larus canus), were analyzed along with 10 available AIV genomes from gulls in Eurasia to search for evidence of intracontinental and intercontinental reassortment of gene segments encoding the internal viral proteins.
   Methods: Swabs collected from 2417 dabbling ducks and gulls in the south-west of Norway during five ordinary hunting seasons (August-December) in the period 2005-2010 were analyzed for presence of AIV. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify associations between AIV prevalence, host species and sampling time. Five AIVs from mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) (H3N8, H9N2) and common gull (H6N8, H13N2, H16N3) were full-length characterized and phylogenetically analyzed together with GenBank reference sequences.
   Results: Low pathogenic AIVs were detected in 15.5% (CI: 14.1-17.0) of the samples. The overall AIV prevalence was lower in December compared to that found in August to November (p = 0.003). AIV was detected in 18.7% (CI: 16.8-20.6) of the dabbling ducks. A high AIV prevalence of 7.8% (CI; 5.9-10.0) was found in gulls. A similar temporal pattern in AIV prevalence was found in both bird groups. Thirteen hemagglutinin and eight neuraminidase subtypes were detected. No evidence of intercontinental reassortment was found. Eurasian avian (non H13 and H16) PB2 or PA genes were identified in five reference Eurasian gull (H13 and H16) AIV genomes from GenBank. The NA gene from the Norwegian H13N2 gull isolate was of Eurasian avian origin.
   Conclusions: The similar temporal pattern in AIV prevalence found in dabbling ducks and gulls, the relatively high virus prevalence detected in gulls and the evidence of intracontinental reassortment in AIVs from gulls indicate that gulls that interact with dabbling ducks are likely to be mixing vessels for AIVs from waterfowl and gulls. Our results support that intercontinental reassortment is rare in AIVs from gulls in Eurasia.

AB Phages are recognized as the most abundant and diverse entities on the planet. Their diversity is determined predominantly by their dynamic adaptation capacities when confronted with different selective pressures in an endless cycle of coevolution with a widespread group of bacterial hosts. At the end of the infection cycle, progeny virions are confronted with a rigid cell wall that hinders their release into the environment and the opportunity to start a new infection cycle. Consequently, phages encode hydrolytic enzymes, called endolysins, to digest the peptidoglycan. In this work, we bring to light all phage endolysins found in completely sequenced double-stranded nucleic acid phage genomes and uncover clues that explain the phage-endolysin-host ecology that led phages to recruit unique and specialized endolysins.

AB HcRNAV is a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus that specifically infects the bivalve-killing dinoflagellate, Heterocapsa circularisquama. HcRNAV strains are grouped into 2 types (UA and CY), based on intra-species host specificity and the amino acid sequence of the major capsid protein (MCP). In the present study, we report the isolation of novel HcRNAV clones (n=51) lytic to the H. circularisquama strains, HU9433-P, HCLG-1, 05HC05 and 05HC06. HcRNAV34, HcRNAV109, HcRNAV641, and HcRNAV659, which displayed lytic activity against the strains, HU9433-P, HCLG-1, 05HC05, and 05HC06, respectively, were selected as typical virus clones and were intensively examined. The infection intensity of each host-virus combination was analyzed by examining the algicidal activity, detecting the intracellular replication of the viral RNA as well as the appearance of host cells with a morphologically abnormal nucleus post-infection. Interestingly, the strains, 05HC05 and 05HC06, were markedly sensitive to HcRNAV641 and HcRNAV659, respectively. Tertiary structural modeling predicted 4 unique amino acid (aa) substitutions in HcRNAV659-MCP to be exposed to an ambient water environment, which contributed towards determining its infection specificity. Neighbor-joining analysis of MCP aa sequences from HcRNAV clones revealed 3 clades, namely, the CY type and the UA1 and UA2 subtypes. The HcRNAV clones lytic to HCLG-1 (ex. HcRNAV109), HU9433-P and 05HC05 (ex. HcRNAV34), and 05HC06 (ex. HcRNAV659) were categorized into CY type, UA1 and UA2 subtypes, respectively. The present study highlights the complexity of the H. circularisquama-HcRNAV host-virus system, i.e., clonal variation, microbial control, and ecology in a natural algal population.

TI Abundant SAR11 viruses in the ocean
SO NATURE

DT Article
ID MARINE; POPULATION; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS
AB Several reports proposed that the extraordinary dominance of the SAR11 bacterial clade in ocean ecosystems could be a consequence of unusual mechanisms of resistance to bacteriophage infection, including 'cryptic escape' through reduced cell size(1) and/or K-strategist defence specialism(2). Alternatively, the evolution of high surface-to-volume ratios coupled with minimal genomes containing high-affinity transporters enables unusually efficient metabolism for oxidizing dissolved organic matter in the world's oceans that could support vast population sizes despite phage susceptibility. These ideas are important for understanding plankton ecology because they emphasize the potentially important role of top-down mechanisms in predation, thus determining the size of SAR11 populations and their concomitant role in biogeochemical cycling. Here we report the isolation of diverse SAR11 viruses belonging to two virus families in culture, for which we propose the name 'pelagiphage', after their host. Notably; the pelagiphage genomes were highly represented in marine viral metagenomes, demonstrating their importance in nature. One of the new phages, HTVC010P, represents a new podovirus subfamily more abundant than any seen previously, in all data sets tested, and may represent one of the most abundant virus subfamilies in the biosphere. This discovery disproves the theory that SAR11 cells are immune to viral predation and is consistent with the interpretation that the success of this highly abundant microbial clade is the result of successfully evolved adaptation to resource competition.

AB Phage and their bacterial hosts are the most abundant and genetically diverse group of organisms on the planet. Given their dominance, it is no wonder that many recent studies have found that phage-bacteria interactions strongly influence global biogeochemical cycles, incidence of human diseases, productivity of industrial microbial commodities, and patterns of microbial genome diversity. Unfortunately, given the extreme diversity and complexity of microbial communities, traditional analyses fail to characterize interaction patterns and underlying processes. Here, we review emerging systems approaches that combine empirical data with rigorous theoretical analysis to study phage-bacterial interactions as networks rather than as coupled interactions in isolation.

AB Marine microbial communities are complex and dynamic, and their ecology impacts biogeochemical cycles in pelagic ecosystems. Yet, little is known about the relative activities of different microbial populations within genetically diverse communities. We used rRNA as a proxy for activity to quantify the relative specific activities (rRNA/ribosomal DNA [rDNA or rRNA genes]) of the eubacterial populations and to identify locations or clades for which there are uncouplings between specific activity and abundance. After analyzing 1.6 million sequences from 16S rDNA and rRNA (cDNA) libraries from two euphotic depths from a representative site in the Pacific Ocean, we show that although there is an overall positive relationship between the abundances (rDNAs) and activities (rRNAs) among populations of the bacterial community, for some populations these measures are uncoupled. Different ecological strategies are exemplified by the two numerically dominant clades at this site: the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is abundant but disproportionately more active, while the heterotrophic SAR11 is abundant but less active. Other rare populations, such as Alteromonas, have high specific activities in spite of their low abundances, suggesting intense population regulation. More detailed analyses using a complementary quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based approach of measuring relative specific activity for Prochlorococcus populations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans also show that specific activity, but not abundance, reflects the key drivers of light and nutrients in this system; our results also suggest substantial top-down regulation (e.g., grazing, viruses, or organismal interactions) or transport (e.g., mixing, immigration, or emigration) of these populations. Thus, we show here that abundance and specific activity can be uncoupled in open ocean systems and that describing both is critical to characterizing microbial communities and predicting marine ecosystem functioning and responses to change.

AB Many laboratories are actively studying the abundance and roles of viruses in natural ecosystems. In these studies, the presence and number of viral particles is usually determined using fluorescent dyes. However, DNA associated with membrane-derived vesicles (MVs), gene transfer agents (GTAs), or cell debris can produce fluorescent dots that can be confused with viral particles. We suspect that fluorescence counting can lead to overestimation of virus numbers and even suggest the presence of viruses when there are none. Future studies in environmental virology should acknowledge this point and consider how to bypass this problem. Besides trying to improve discrimination between virions and MVs, we suggest adopting less holistic approaches, focusing on the detection of known virus groups and the isolation of new viruses from a broader range of hosts.

TI Silage Collected from Dairy Farms Harbors an Abundance of Listeriaphages

AB Since the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is common in dairy farm environments, it is likely that phages infecting this bacterium ("listeriaphages") are abundant on dairy farms. To better understand the ecology and diversity of listeriaphages on dairy farms and to develop a diverse phage collection for further studies, silage samples collected on two dairy farms were screened for L. monocytogenes and listeriaphages. While only 4.5% of silage samples tested positive for L. monocytogenes, 47.8% of samples were positive for listeriaphages, containing up to >1.5 x 10(4) PFU/g. Host range characterization of the 114 phage isolates obtained, with a reference set of 13 L. monocytogenes strains representing the nine major serotypes and four lineages, revealed considerable host range diversity; phage isolates were classified into nine lysis groups. While one serotype 3c strain was not lysed by any phage isolates, serotype 4 strains were highly susceptible to phages and were lysed by 63.2 to 88.6% of phages tested. Overall, 12.3% of phage isolates showed a narrow host range (lysing 1 to 5 strains), while 28.9% of phages represented broad host range (lysing >= 11 strains). Genome sizes of the phage isolates were estimated to range from approximately 26 to 140 kb. The extensive host range and genomic diversity of phages observed here suggest an important role of phages in the ecology of L. monocytogenes on dairy farms. In addition, the phage collection developed here has the potential to facilitate further development of phage-based biocontrol strategies (e.g., in silage) and other phage-based tools.

AB Background: One of the most effective targets for control of zoonotic foodborne pathogens in the farm to fork continuum is their elimination in food animals destined for market. Phage therapy for Escherichia coli O157: H7 in ruminants, the main animal reservoir of this pathogen, is a popular research topic. Since phages active against this pathogen may be endemic in host animals and their environment, they may emerge during trials of phage therapy or other interventions, rendering interpretation of trials problematic.
   Methods: During separate phage therapy trials, sheep and cattle inoculated with 10(9) to 10(10) CFU of E. coli O157:H7 soon began shedding phages dissimilar in plaque morphology to the administered therapeutic phages. None of the former was previously identified in the animals or in their environment. The dissimilar "rogue" phage was isolated and characterized by host range, ultrastructure, and genomic and proteomic analyses.
   Results: The "rogue" phage (Phage vB_EcoS_Rogue1) is distinctly different from the administered therapeutic Myoviridae phages, being a member of the Siphoviridae (head: 53 nm; striated tail: 152 x 8 nm). It has a 45.8 kb genome which is most closely related to coliphage JK06, a member of the "T1-like viruses" isolated in Israel. Detailed bioinformatic analysis reveals that the tail of these phages is related to the tail genes of coliphage lambda. The presence of "rogue" phages resulting from natural enrichments can pose problems in the interpretation of phage therapeutic studies. Similarly, evaluation of any interventions for foodborne or other bacterial pathogens in animals may be compromised unless tests for such phages are included to identify their presence and potential impact.

AB Influenza viruses from domestic aquatic birds can be transmitted to chickens, resulting in continued prevalence of the disease. H3 viruses are one of the most frequently identified subtypes in domestic ducks. Results from our previous serologic study suggested that H3 virus infections potentially exist in chickens with a wide geographical distribution in China. To better understand their pathogenic potential, two H3N8 influenza viruses isolated from domestic ducks were selected for experimental infections in chickens. We found that viral shedding lasted for at least 14 days postinfection for both viruses; however, one virus caused mortality in the chickens when coinfected with Escherichia coli. Sequencing of the viral HA gene isolated from the inoculated chickens revealed two amino acid mutations within the gene. These findings demonstrate the pathogenicity of the H3N8 domestic duck influenza viruses to chickens, highlighting the need for routine epidemiologic investigations of H3 subtype influenza viruses in chicken populations.

AB Bacteriophages are likely the most abundant entities in the aquatic environment, yet knowledge of their ecology is limited. During a fecal source-tracking study, two genetically novel Leviviridae strains were discovered. Although the novel strains were isolated from coastal waters 1130 km apart (North Carolina and Rhode Island, USA), these strains shared 97% nucleotide similarity and 97-100% amino acid similarity. When the novel strains were compared to nine Levivirus genogroup I strains, they shared 95-100% similarity among the maturation, capsid and lysis proteins, but only 84-85% in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. Further bioinformatic analyses suggested a recombination event occurred. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of viral recombinants in environmental Leviviridae ssRNA bacteriophages.

AB Culex erraticus (Dyar & Knab) is a competent vector of Eastern equine encephalitis virus and subtype IC Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and both St. Louis encephalitis virus and West Nile virus have been isolated from field-collected specimens. Previous bloodmeal analysis studies have shown this species to be a generalist, feeding on a variety of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. This behavior can bridge arboviral transmission across different vertebrate groups. Our study examined the host preference of Cx. erraticus at Sonso Lake in Colombia. From July to August 2008, blood-engorged mosquitoes were collected from resting boxes, while vertebrate abundance was determined to calculate host preference. Based on mitochondrial DNA analysis of bloodmeals, birds were the predominant hosts (57.6%), followed by mammals (30.8%), and reptiles (6.7%); 9.5% of the bloodmeals were mixed. The most commonly fed upon species were: limpkin, black-crowned nightheron, striated heron, human, and capybara. Forage ratios showed the least bittern, limpkin, Cocoi heron, striated heron, capybara, and black-crowned night heron were preferred hosts across all vertebrates. Of the available avifauna, the least bittern, limpkin, striated heron, Cocoi heron, and black-crowned night heron were preferred, whereas the bare faced ibis, great egret, snowy egret, and cattle egret were under-used. This study shows that while Cx. erraticus is an opportunistic feeder, using diverse vertebrate hosts in the environment, certain avian species are targeted preferentially for bloodmeals.

AB This study identifies population and environment drivers of genetic change in H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIV) in Vietnam using a landscape genetics approach. While prior work has examined how combinations of local-level environmental variables influence H5N1 occurrence, this research expands the analysis to the complex genetic characteristics of H5N1 viruses. A dataset of 125 highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV isolated in Vietnam from 2003 to 2007 is used to explore which population and environment variables are correlated with increased genetic change among viruses. Results from non-parametric multidimensional scaling and regression analyses indicate that variables relating to both the environmental and social ecology of humans and birds in Vietnam interact to affect the genetic character of viruses. These findings suggest that it is a combination of suitable environments for species mixing, the presence of high numbers of potential hosts, and in particular the temporal characteristics of viral occurrence, that drive genetic change among H5N1 AIV in Vietnam.

AB Because viruses of eukaryotic algae are incredibly diverse, sweeping generalizations about their ecology are rare. These obligate parasites infect a range of algae and their diversity can be illustrated by considering that isolates range from small particles with ssRNA genomes to much larger particles with 560 kb dsDNA genomes. Molecular research has also provided clues about the extent of their diversity especially considering that genetic signatures of algal viruses in the environment rarely match cultivated viruses. One general concept in algal virus ecology that has emerged is that algal viruses are very host specific and most infect only certain strains of their hosts; with the exception of viruses of brown algae, evidence for interspecies infectivity is lacking. Although some hostvirus systems behave with boom-bust oscillations, complex patterns of intraspecies infectivity can lead to hostvirus coexistence obfuscating the role of viruses in host population dynamics. Within the framework of population dynamics, host density dependence is an important phenomenon that influences virus abundances in nature. Variable burst sizes of different viruses also influence their abundances and permit speculations about different life strategies, but as exceptions are common in algal virus ecology, life strategy generalizations may not be broadly applicable. Gaps in knowledge of virus seasonality and persistence are beginning to close and investigations of environmental reservoirs and virus resilience may answer questions about virus inter-annual recurrences. Studies of algal mortality have shown that viruses are often important agents of mortality reinforcing notions about their ecological relevance, while observations of the surprising ways viruses interact with their hosts highlight the immaturity of our understanding. Considering that just two decades ago algal viruses were hardly acknowledged, recent progress affords the optimistic perspective that future studies will provide keys to unlocking our understanding of algal virus ecology specifically, and aquatic ecosystems generally.

AB As part of our ongoing efforts on animal influenza surveillance in Argentina, an H9N2 virus was isolated from a wild aquatic bird (Netta peposaca), A/rosy-billed pochard/Argentina/CIP051-559/2007 (H9N2) - herein referred to as 559/H9N2. Due to the important role that H9N2 viruses play in the ecology of influenza in nature, the 559/H9N2 isolate was characterized molecularly and biologically. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that the 559/H9N2 virus maintained an independent evolutionary pathway and shared a sister-group relationship with North American viruses, suggesting a common ancestor. The rest of the genome segments clustered with viruses from South America. Experimental inoculation of the 559/H9N2 in chickens and quail revealed efficient replication and transmission only in quail. Our results add to the notion of the unique evolutionary trend of avian influenza viruses in South America. Our study increases our understanding of H9N2 viruses in nature and emphasizes the importance of expanding animal influenza surveillance efforts to better define the ecology of influenza viruses at a global scale.

AB Monitoring of waterborne pathogens is improved by using concentration methods prior to detection; however, direct microbial enumeration is desired to study microbial ecology and human health risks. The aim of this work was to determine Salmonella presence in river water with an ultrafiltration system coupled with the ISO 6579:1993 isolation standard method (UFS-ISO). Most probable number (MPN) method was used directly in water samples to estimate Salmonella populations. Additionally, the effect between Salmonella determination and water turbidity was evaluated. Ten liters or three tenfold dilutions (1, 0.1, and 0.01 mL) of water were processed for Salmonella detection and estimation by the UFS-ISO and MPN methods, respectively. A total of 84 water samples were tested, and Salmonella was confirmed in 64/84 (76%) and 38/84 (44%) when UFS-ISO and MPN were used, respectively. Salmonella populations were less than 5 x 10(3) MPN/L in 73/84 of samples evaluated (87%), and only three (3.5%) showed contamination with numbers greater than 4.5 x 10(4) MPN/L. Water turbidity did not affect Salmonella determination regardless of the performed method. These findings suggest that Salmonella abundance in Sinaloa rivers is not a health risk for human infections in spite of its persistence. Thus, choosing the appropriate strategy to study Salmonella in river water samples is necessary to clarify its behavior and transport in the environment.

   CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE
AB Background: Proteinaceous toxins are observed across all levels of inter-organismal and intra-genomic conflicts. These include recently discovered prokaryotic polymorphic toxin systems implicated in intra-specific conflicts. They are characterized by a remarkable diversity of C-terminal toxin domains generated by recombination with standalone toxin-coding cassettes. Prior analysis revealed a striking diversity of nuclease and deaminase domains among the toxin modules. We systematically investigated polymorphic toxin systems using comparative genomics, sequence and structure analysis.
   Results: Polymorphic toxin systems are distributed across all major bacterial lineages and are delivered by at least eight distinct secretory systems. In addition to type-II, these include type-V, VI, VII (ESX), and the poorly characterized "Photorhabdus virulence cassettes (PVC)", PrsW-dependent and MuF phage-capsid-like systems. We present evidence that trafficking of these toxins is often accompanied by autoproteolytic processing catalyzed by HINT, ZU5, PrsW, caspase-like, papain-like, and a novel metallopeptidase associated with the PVC system. We identified over 150 distinct toxin domains in these systems. These span an extraordinary catalytic spectrum to include 23 distinct clades of peptidases, numerous previously unrecognized versions of nucleases and deaminases, ADP-ribosyltransferases, ADP ribosyl cyclases, RelA/SpoT-like nucleotidyltransferases, glycosyltranferases and other enzymes predicted to modify lipids and carbohydrates, and a pore-forming toxin domain. Several of these toxin domains are shared with host-directed effectors of pathogenic bacteria. Over 90 families of immunity proteins might neutralize anywhere between a single to at least 27 distinct types of toxin domains. In some organisms multiple tandem immunity genes or immunity protein domains are organized into polyimmunity loci or polyimmunity proteins. Gene-neighborhood-analysis of polymorphic toxin systems predicts the presence of novel trafficking-related components, and also the organizational logic that allows toxin diversification through recombination. Domain architecture and protein-length analysis revealed that these toxins might be deployed as secreted factors, through directed injection, or via inter-cellular contact facilitated by filamentous structures formed by RHS/YD, filamentous hemagglutinin and other repeats. Phyletic pattern and life-style analysis indicate that polymorphic toxins and polyimmunity loci participate in cooperative behavior and facultative 'cheating' in several ecosystems such as the human oral cavity and soil. Multiple domains from these systems have also been repeatedly transferred to eukaryotes and their viruses, such as the nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses.
   Conclusions: Along with a comprehensive inventory of toxins and immunity proteins, we present several testable predictions regarding active sites and catalytic mechanisms of toxins, their processing and trafficking and their role in intra-specific and inter-specific interactions between bacteria. These systems provide insights regarding the emergence of key systems at different points in eukaryotic evolution, such as ADP ribosylation, interaction of myosin VI with cargo proteins, mediation of apoptosis, hyphal heteroincompatibility, hedgehog signaling, arthropod toxins, cell-cell interaction molecules like teneurins and different signaling messengers.

AB Domestic ducks in southern China act as an important reservoir for influenza viruses and have also facilitated the establishment of multiple H6 influenza virus lineages. To understand the continuing evolution of these established lineages, 297 H6 viruses isolated from domestic ducks during 2006 and 2007 were genetically and antigenically analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses showed that group II duck H6 viruses had replaced the previously predominant group I lineage and extended their geographic distribution from coastal to inland regions. Group II H6 virus showed that the genesis and development of multiple types of deletions in the neuraminidase (NA) stalk region could occur in the influenza viruses from domestic ducks. A gradual replacement of the N2 NA subtype with N6 was observed. Significant antigenic changes occurred within group II H6 viruses so that they became antigenically distinguishable from group I and gene pool viruses. Gene exchange between group II H6 viruses and the established H5N1, H9N2, or H6N1 virus lineages in poultry in the region was very limited. These findings suggest that domestic ducks can facilitate significant genetic and antigenic changes in viruses established in this host and highlight gaps in our knowledge of influenza virus ecology and even the evolutionary behavior of this virus family in its aquatic avian reservoirs.

AB In 2003, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) emerged in the Laurentian Great Lakes causing serious losses in a number of ecologically and recreationally important fish species. Within six years, despite concerted managerial preventive measures, the virus spread into the five Great Lakes and to a number of inland waterbodies. In response to this emerging threat, cooperative efforts between the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MI DNR), the Michigan State University Aquatic Animal Health Laboratory (MSU-AAHL), and the United States Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (USDA-APHIS) were focused on performing a series of general and VHSV-targeted surveillances to determine the extent of virus trafficking in the State of Michigan. Herein we describe six years (2005-2010) of testing, covering hundreds of sites throughout Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas. A total of 96,228 fish representing 73 species were checked for lesions suggestive of VHSV and their internal organs tested for the presence of VHSV using susceptible cell lines. Of the 1,823 cases tested, 30 cases from 19 fish species tested positive for VHSV by tissue culture and were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Gene sequence analyses of all VHSV isolates retrieved in Michigan demonstrated that they belong to the emerging sublineage "b" of the North American VHSV genotype IV. These findings underscore the complexity of VHSV ecology in the Great Lakes basin and the critical need for rigorous legislation and regulatory guidelines in order to reduce the virus spread within and outside of the Laurentian Great Lakes watershed.

AB Plasmids are self-replicating genetic elements capable of mobilization between different hosts. Plasmids often serve as mediators of lateral gene transfer, a process considered to be a strong and sculpting evolutionary force in microbial environments. Our aim was to characterize the overall plasmid population in the environment of the bovine rumen, which houses a complex and dense microbiota that holds enormous significance for humans. We developed a procedure for the isolation of total rumen plasmid DNA, termed rumen plasmidome, and subjected it to deep sequencing using the Illumina paired-end protocol and analysis using public and custom-made bioinformatics tools. A large number of plasmidome contigs aligned with plasmids of rumen bacteria isolated from different locations and at various time points, suggesting that not only the bacterial taxa, but also their plasmids, are defined by the ecological niche. The bacterial phylum distribution of the plasmidome was different from that of the rumen bacterial taxa. Nevertheless, both shared a dominance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Evidently, the rumen plasmidome is of a highly mosaic nature that can cross phyla. Interestingly, when we compared the functional profile of the rumen plasmidome to two plasmid databases and two recently published rumen metagenomes, it became apparent that the rumen plasmidome codes for functions, which are enriched in the rumen ecological niche and could confer advantages to their hosts, suggesting that the functional profiles of mobile genetic elements are associated with their environment, as has been previously implied for viruses.

AB Aim: To conduct epidemiological and ecological surveillance of cholera in freshwater environments.
   Methods and Results: A freshwater region of India was surveyed between April 2007 and December 2008. Vibrio cholerae was isolated from 59.5% of water and plankton samples (n = 357) and 35.5% of stool samples (n = 290). Isolation from water was dependent on air (r = 0 44) and water temperatures (r = 0 49) (P < 0 01) but was independent of rainfall (r = 0 15), chlorophyll a (r = 0 18), salinity (r = 0 2) or pH (r = 0 2) (P > 0 05). Isolation from plankton was dependent on temperature of air (r = 0 45), water temperature (r = 0 44), chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0 42), pH (r = 0 23) and salinity (r = 0 39) (P < 0 01). Cholera cases correlated with rainfall (r = 0 82, P < 0 01) and chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0 42, P < 0 05), but not with air temperature (r = 0 3, P = 0 37). Vibrio cholerae O1 possessed ctxB, ctxA, rstR and tcpA (ElTor), toxR, toxT, rtxA, rtxC, mshA and hylA. Among non-O1-non-O139, the distribution of virulence-associated and regulatory protein genes was heterogeneous with -0.7, 2 2, 94 77, 97 76, 99 25, 100 and 100% isolates being positive for tcpA, toxT, rtxA, rtxC, hylA, toxR and mshA, respectively. Two-thirds of non-O1-non-O139 isolates exhibited antibiotic resistance to various antibiotics that did not correlate with geographical site or time of origin for the isolates. RAPD and AFLP showed V. cholerae to be a diverse bacterium. AFLP demonstrated separate lineages for non-O1-non-O139 and O1 isolates.
   Conclusion: Environmental parameters played a significant role in the emergence and spread of cholera and the abundance of V. cholerae. But based on virulence gene profiling and genetic fingerprinting, the possibility of origin of toxigenic isolates from nontoxigenic environmental isolates seems unlikely in freshwater environs of India.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study explains the ecology, epidemiology and seasonality of cholera in freshwater environs.

AB Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play an important role in balancing microbes within an ecosystem and facilitating horizontal gene transfer. Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interaction with the rumen microbiome. We undertook random pyrosequencing of virus-enriched metagenomes (viromes) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analysed the resulting data using comparative metagenomics. A high level of diversity was observed with up to 28 000 different viral genotypes obtained from each environment. The majority (similar to 78%) of sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outnumbered lytic phages approximately 2: 1 with the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types being associated with members of the dominant rumen phyla (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. We expanded our analysis to include previously described metagenomic data and 14 reference genomes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were detected in most of the microbial genomes, suggesting previous interactions between viral and microbial communities.

AB Lytic viruses have been implicated in the massive cellular lysis observed during algal blooms, through which they assume a prominent role in oceanic carbon and nutrient flows. Despite their impact on biogeochemical cycling, the transcriptional dynamics of these important oceanic events is still poorly understood. Here, we employ an oligonucleotide microarray to monitor host (Emiliania huxleyi) and virus (coccolithovirus) transcriptomic features during the course of E. huxleyi blooms induced in seawater-based mesocosm enclosures. Host bloom development and subsequent coccolithovirus infection was associated with a major shift in transcriptional profile. In addition to the expected metabolic requirements typically associated with viral infection (amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, as well as transcription- and replication-associated functions), the results strongly suggest that the manipulation of lipid metabolism plays a fundamental role during hostvirus interaction. The results herein reveal the scale, so far massively underestimated, of the transcriptional domination that occurs during coccolithovirus infection in the natural environment.

AB Infection by Penicillium marneffei is an important emerging public health problem, especially among travelers and inhabitants in SE China and SE Asia infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In recent years, the number of patients with penicilliosis marneffei (PM) has increased rapidly in Guangdong province, SE China. However, the natural habitat and transmission mode of the etiologic agent remains unclear. In this study, wild rats (Microtus, focus Rattus and Rhizomys pruinosus) and soil samples were collected from rat burrows, populated and rural areas from November 2007 to December 2008 for fungus cultures. All isolates, suspected of being P. marneffei, were identified by gross and microscopic morphology and ITS analysis. Sixteen of 23 (about 70%) bamboo rats were P. marneffei positive, whereas none was recovered from hamsters, loirs or soil. This suggests that as of today the bamboo rat is the exclusive natural reservoir for P. marneffei. Definite evidence that rodents are a part of the infectious cycle is still lacking.

AB Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the gastric mucosa in more than half of the human population; in a subset of this population, its presence is associated with development of severe disease, such as gastric cancer. Genomic analysis of several strains has revealed an extensive H. pylori pan-genome, likely to grow as more genomes are sampled. Here we describe the draft genome sequence (63 contigs; 26x mean coverage) of H. pylori strain B45, isolated from a patient with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The major finding was a 24.6-kb prophage integrated in the bacterial genome. The prophage shares most of its genes (22/27) with prophage region II of Helicobacter acinonychis strain Sheeba. After UV treatment of liquid cultures, circular DNA carrying the prophage integrase gene could be detected, and intracellular tailed phage-like particles were observed in H. pylori cells by transmission electron microscopy, indicating that phage production can be induced from the prophage. PCR amplification and sequencing of the integrase gene from 341 H. pylori strains from different geographic regions revealed a high prevalence of the prophage (21.4%). Phylogenetic reconstruction showed four distinct clusters in the integrase gene, three of which tended to be specific for geographic regions. Our study implies that phages may play important roles in the ecology and evolution of H. pylori.
   IMPORTANCE Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the gastric mucosa in more than half of the human population, and while most of the infected individuals do not develop disease, H. pylori infection doubles the risk of developing gastric cancer. An abundance and diversity of viruses (phages) infect microbial populations in most environments and are important mediators of microbial diversity. Our finding of a 24.6-kb prophage integrated inside an H. pylori genome and the observation of circular integrase gene-containing DNA and phage-like particles inside cells upon UV treatment demonstrate that we have discovered a viable H. pylori phage. The additional finding of integrase genes in a large proportion of screened isolates of diverse geographic origins indicates that the prevalence of prophages may have been underestimated in H. pylori. Since phages are important drivers of microbial evolution, the discovery should be important for understanding and predicting genetic diversity in H. pylori.

AB Salmonella enterica serovar Napoli is an emerging serovar in Italy, France, and Switzerland, but little is known about its pathogenicity to humans. A collection of 112 strains of Salmonella Napoli isolated in Italy from human cases, foods of animal origin, and the environment have been characterized by the detection of a set of virulence genes, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and antibiotic susceptibility. All the strains examined were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested. The Salmonella pathogenicity islands genes ssaQ, mgtC spi_4D, and sopB were present from 75.0% to 100% of the tested strains. Only one human and four environmental strains showed the avrA gene. The phage-related sopE1 gene was present in 93% of the strains, whereas sodC1 and gipA genes were only in four and two environmental strains, respectively. The bcfC fimbrial gene was present in all the animal/food strains, in the 71.4% of environmental strains, and in 46.8% of the human strains, respectively. Overall, we observed 10 distinct virulence profiles (VP), but VP1-2-3 included 99 out of 112 strains. PFGE showed that 103 out of 111 isolates were grouped in four major clusters and three minor clusters, whereas two strains were totally unrelated. The most represented PFGE clusters mainly correlated with the virulotypes are VP1, VP2, and VP3. Salmonella Napoli shows an array of virulence genes similar to other serovars considered of public health importance and confirming its capability to cause infection in human. Concerning possible source of infection or reservoirs, the results did not point out any, but our hypothesis is that the environment can act as the main reservoir for Salmonella Napoli, and from there it can spill over to animals and humans. Further studies are needed to increase the knowledge on the ecology of Salmonella Napoli serovar and on the main risk factors for human infection.

AB We surveyed the major capsid genes (g23) of T4-type bacteriophages using the primers MZIA1 bis and MZIA6 and DNA extracted from seven upland black soils in Northeast China. In total, 99 different g23 clones were obtained. Approximately half of the clones fell into paddy groups, whereas the rest belonged to one of several groups containing only clones from upland black soils or remained ungrouped, suggesting that the T4-type phage communities in the upland black soil were relatively similar to those in paddy field soils but that specific communities exclusively inhabit the upland black soil. UniFrac analysis of all of the g23 clones obtained from various environments indicated that the T4-type phage communities varied among marine, lake, paddy field soil and upland soil environments and that the T4-type phage communities in upland black soils varied by sampling location.

AB Viral genomes often contain genes recently acquired from microbes. In some cases (for example, psbA) the proteins encoded by these genes have been shown to be important for viral replication. In this study, using a unique search strategy on the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) metagenomes in combination with marine virome and microbiome pyrosequencing-based datasets, we characterize previously undetected microbial metabolic capabilities concealed within the genomes of uncultured marine viral communities. A total of 34 microbial gene families were detected on 452 viral GOS scaffolds. The majority of auxiliary metabolic genes found on these scaffolds have never been reported in phages. Host genes detected in viruses were mainly divided between genes encoding for different energy metabolism pathways, such as electron transport and newly identified photosystem genes, or translation and post-translation mechanism related. Our findings suggest previously undetected ways, in which marine phages adapt to their hosts and improve their fitness, including translation and post-translation level control over the host rather than the already known transcription level control.

AB Background European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are common, widely distributed birds in North America that frequently come into contact with agricultural operations. However, starlings have been one of the neglected land-based wild bird species for influenza surveillance.
   Objectives To study the potential role of starlings in the ecology and epidemiology of influenza virus.
   Methods We collected 328 digestive and 156 tracheal samples from starlings in Ohio in years 2007 (July) to 2008 (August) and screened for the presence of influenza virus by real-time RT-PCR, standard RT-PCR and virus isolation using embryonated chicken eggs. In addition, we conducted an experimental infection study to evaluate the replication and induction of antibody response by two low pathogenic avian influenza (AI) viruses in starlings.
   Results Although virus isolation was negative, we confirmed 21 influenza positive digestive and tracheal samples by real-time and standard RT-PCR tests. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that five NS genes recovered from Starlings belonged to NS subtype A and were most similar to the NS genes from a wild aquatic bird origin isolate from Ohio. Experimental infection studies using two low pathogenic AI strains showed that starlings could be infected, shed virus, and seroconvert.
   Conclusions This study shows that starlings can carry influenza virus that is genetically similar to wild aquatic bird origin strains and may serve as a carrier of influenza virus to domestic animals.

AB The investigation of marine viruses has advanced our understanding of ecology, evolution, microbiology, oceanography and virology. Significant findings discussed in this review include the discovery of giant viruses that have genome sizes and metabolic capabilities that distort the line between virus and cell, viruses that participate in photosynthesis and apoptosis, the detection of communities of viruses of all genomic compositions and the preeminence of viruses in the evolution of marine microbes. Although we have made great progress, we have yet to synthesize the rich archive of viral genomic data with oceanographic processes. The development of cutting edge methods such as single virus genomics now provide a toolset to better integrate viruses into the ecology of the ocean.

AB Metagenomic analyses of viruses have revealed widespread diversity in the viriosphere, but it remains a challenge to identify specific hosts for a viral assemblage. To address this problem, we analyze the viral metagenome of a northeast Pacific hydrothermal vent with a comprehensive database of spacers derived from the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) putative immune system. CRISPR spacer matches to the marine vent virome suggest that viruses infecting hosts from diverse taxonomic groups are present in this vent environment. Comparative virome analyses show that CRISPR spacers from vent isolates and from thermophiles in general have a higher percentage of matches to the vent virome than to other marine or terrestrial hot spring viromes. However, a high percentage of hits to spacers from mesophilic hosts, combined with a moderately high modeled alpha diversity, suggest that the marine vent virome is comprised of viruses that have the potential to infect diverse taxonomic groups of multiple thermal regimes in both the bacterial and the archaeal domains.

AB Various incubation conditions (35A degrees C-38A degrees C, 2-7 days) have been used in surveillance studies of the prevalence of avian influenza viruses in wild birds. Here, we studied viral polymerase activity and virus growth kinetics of low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) isolated from field samples [A/duck/Hong Kong/365/1978 (H4N6) and A/duck/Nanchang/2-0480/2000 (H9N2)] during incubation at different temperatures (35A degrees C, 37A degrees C, and 39A degrees C) in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). The higher incubation temperatures (37A degrees C and 39A degrees C) resulted in a significantly higher rate of virus growth, which is most likely a result of increased viral polymerase activity (20%-60%), than was observed at 35A degrees C, and as much as a 100% greater virus yield (as measured by hemagglutination assay) was observed two days after inoculation. Our findings revealed that the optimal activity of the viral polymerase complex, resulting in the highest yield of LPAIV field isolates, could be obtained by incubation for two days in ECE at 37A degrees C and 39A degrees C.

AB Aquatic viruses are extraordinarily diverse and have major influences on plankton ecology and evolution, but the majority of these viruses remain uncharacterized. Most viruses have not been cultivated and cultivation-independent means to explore viral diversity have provided only a fragmented view of viral genomic information. In this study, ultracentrifugation and chromatographic methods were evaluated for their ability to fractionate aquatic viruses based on their differing physical properties with the aim of physically enriching subsets of aquatic viruses for further study. Centrifugation in continuous cesium chloride gradients, strong and weak anion-exchange chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography with Sephacryl S-1000 were found to separate aquatic viruses based on their differing buoyant densities, surface charges, and sizes, respectively. Sucrose density gradients, cation-exchange chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography using controlled-pore glass were found to have insufficient resolution to effectively separate viral assemblages. Using the successful methods listed above, we were able to separate complex assemblages of viruses into fractions that had distinguishable subsets of the viruses present in the original community as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Strong anion-exchange chromatography was particularly effective at separating viruses in the samples and resulted in one to six dominant viral genome bands in most fractions. Our results suggest that individual populations of viruses may be physically enriched, and possibly isolated, from complex assemblages without cultivation. These fractionation methods are expected to improve our ability to characterize the genotypes and phenotypes of the uncultivated majority of viruses in aquatic environments.

AB P>Ocean viruses alter ecosystems through host mortality, horizontal gene transfer and by facilitating remineralization of limiting nutrients. However, the study of wild viral populations is limited by inefficient and unreliable concentration techniques. Here, we develop a new technique to recover viruses from natural waters using iron-based flocculation and large-pore-size filtration, followed by resuspension of virus-containing precipitates in a pH 6 buffer. Recovered viruses are amenable to gene sequencing, and a variable proportion of phages, depending upon the phage, retain their infectivity when recovered. This Fe-based virus flocculation, filtration and resuspension method (FFR) is efficient (> 90% recovery), reliable, inexpensive and adaptable to many aspects of marine viral ecology and genomics research.

AB Whole genome amplification and sequencing of single microbial cells has significantly influenced genomics and microbial ecology by facilitating direct recovery of reference genome data. However, viral genomics continues to suffer due to difficulties related to the isolation and characterization of uncultivated viruses. We report here on a new approach called 'Single Virus Genomics', which enabled the isolation and complete genome sequencing of the first single virus particle. A mixed assemblage comprised of two known viruses; E. coli bacteriophages lambda and T4, were sorted using flow cytometric methods and subsequently immobilized in an agarose matrix. Genome amplification was then achieved in situ via multiple displacement amplification (MDA). The complete lambda phage genome was recovered with an average depth of coverage of approximately 437X. The isolation and genome sequencing of uncultivated viruses using Single Virus Genomics approaches will enable researchers to address questions about viral diversity, evolution, adaptation and ecology that were previously unattainable.

AB Viruses are recognized as the most abundant biological components on Earth, and they regulate the structure of microbial communities in many environments. In soil and marine environments, microorganism-infecting phages are the most common type of virus. Although several types of bacteriophage have been isolated from fermented foods, little is known about the overall viral assemblages (viromes) of these environments. In this study, metagenomic analyses were performed on the uncultivated viral communities from three fermented foods, fermented shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique, a total of 81,831, 70,591 and 69,464 viral sequences were obtained from fermented shrimp, kimchi and sauerkraut, respectively. Moreover, 37 to 50% of these sequences showed no significant hit against sequences in public databases. There were some discrepancies between the prediction of bacteriophages hosts via homology comparison and bacterial distribution, as determined from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These discrepancies likely reflect the fact that the viral genomes of fermented foods are poorly represented in public databases. Double-stranded DNA viral communities were amplified from fermented foods by using a linker-amplified shotgun library. These communities were dominated by bacteriophages belonging to the viral order Caudovirales (i.e., Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae). This study indicates that fermented foods contain less complex viral communities than many other environmental habitats, such as seawater, human feces, marine sediment, and soil.

AB An increase in the frequency of seafood-borne gastroenteritis in humans and Vibrio-related disease of fish and invertebrates has generated interest in the ecology of disease-causing Vibrios and the mechanisms driving their evolution. Genome sequencing studies have indicated a substantial contribution of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to the evolution of Vibrios. Of particular interest is the contribution of HGT to the evolution of Vibrios pathogens and the adaptation of disease-causing Vibrios for survival in diverse environments. In this review, we discuss the diversity and distribution of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) isolated from Vibrios and the contribution of these elements to the expansion of the ecological and pathogenic niches of the host strain. Much of the research on Vibrio MGEs has focused on understanding phages and plasmids and we will primarily discuss the evolution of these elements and also briefly highlight the other diverse elements characterized from Vibrios, which includes genomic islands and conjugative elements.

AB The understanding of marine microbial ecology and metabolism has been hampered by the paucity of sequenced reference genomes. To this end, we report the sequencing of 137 diverse marine isolates collected from around the world. We analysed these sequences, along with previously published marine prokaryotic genomes, in the context of marine metagenomic data, to gain insights into the ecology of the surface ocean prokaryotic picoplankton (0.1-3.0 mu m size range). The results suggest that the sequenced genomes define two microbial groups: one composed of only a few taxa that are nearly always abundant in picoplanktonic communities, and the other consisting of many microbial taxa that are rarely abundant. The genomic content of the second group suggests that these microbes are capable of slow growth and survival in energy-limited environments, and rapid growth in energy-rich environments. By contrast, the abundant and cosmopolitan picoplanktonic prokaryotes for which there is genomic representation have smaller genomes, are probably capable of only slow growth and seem to be relatively unable to sense or rapidly acclimate to energy-rich conditions. Their genomic features also lead us to propose that one method used to avoid predation by viruses and/or bacterivores is by means of slow growth and the maintenance of low biomass.

   COMPARATIVE GENOMICS; PHAGE SUPERFAMILY; CHESAPEAKE BAY; INDIAN-OCEAN
AB From genomic sequencing it has become apparent that the marine cyanomyoviruses capable of infecting strains of unicellular cyanobacteria assigned to the genera Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are not only morphologically similar to T4, but are also genetically related, typically sharing some 40-48 genes. The large majority of these common genes are the same in all marine cyanomyoviruses so far characterized. Given the fundamental physiological differences between marine unicellular cyanobacteria and heterotrophic hosts of T4-like phages it is not surprising that the study of cyanomyoviruses has revealed novel and fascinating facets of the phage-host relationship. One of the most interesting features of the marine cyanomyoviruses is their possession of a number of genes that are clearly of host origin such as those involved in photosynthesis, like the psbA gene that encodes a core component of the photosystem II reaction centre. Other host-derived genes encode enzymes involved in carbon metabolism, phosphate acquisition and ppGpp metabolism. The impact of these host-derived genes on phage fitness has still largely to be assessed and represents one of the most important topics in the study of this group of T4-like phages in the laboratory. However, these phages are also of considerable environmental significance by virtue of their impact on key contributors to oceanic primary production and the true extent and nature of this impact has still to be accurately assessed.

AB At least 345 bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus starter cultures have been isolated; general characteristics include high thermal resistance, short latent periods and large burst size. Phages with such characteristics are primed to thrive in the cheese making environment, lysing bacterial cultures and generating low-quality fermented products. All S. thermophilus phages isolated to date are members of the Siphoviridae family and the Caudovirales order and appear to constitute a polythetic phage species comprising two large groups, cos- and pac-types, based on the mode of DNA packaging. Comparative analyses have shown that S. thermophilus phage genomes are similarly organized into distinct modular regions and allow the detection of a core genome region. Several PCR-based techniques have been designed to detect them in cheese whey and milk samples. Similar S. thermophilus phages are globally distributed and endemic in specific dairy environments. The biogeography of S. thermophilus phages reinforces their current classification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We undertook one of the most comprehensive studies on the replication and intraspecies transmission characteristics of low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses in ducks, chickens and turkeys. Our results indicated that most of these isolates could replicate and be transmitted in poultry without inducing clinical disease. However, differences in transmission to contact control birds were noted, emphasizing the importance of having contact control cage mates in biological characterization experiments. Ducks supported the replication of viruses of wild aquatic bird origin in their respiratory and digestive tracts equally well. The viruses from wild aquatic birds were not effectively transmitted among chickens. In contrast, the wild-bird isolates and viruses of domestic bird origin from live-bird markets and commercial poultry operations replicated and were transmitted more efficiently in turkeys than in chickens or ducks. We also found a lower minimal infectious dose requirement for infection of turkeys compared to chickens and ducks. Our data support an important role of turkeys as being more susceptible hosts for avian influenza viruses than domestic ducks and chickens. These results highlight the role of turkeys as intermediate or bridging hosts in the transmission of influenza viruses from wild birds to land-based domestic poultry or among different land-based bird species.

AB The ecology of avian influenza (AI) viruses in wild aquatic birds of Asia is poorly understood, especially for the H5N1 high pathogenicity AI (HPAI) viruses. From March 2006 through November 2008, 20 AI viruses were isolated in the Crimea region of Ukraine with an overall frequency of virus recovery of 3.3%. All the viruses were isolated from three species of dabbling ducks: mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), wigeon (Anas penelope), and garganey (Anas querquedula), making the frequency of virus recovery for dabbling ducks 6.3%. The viruses were predominantly isolated during the fall sampling period. All viruses were genetically and antigenically characterized. No H5N1 HPAI viruses were isolated, but other HA and NA subtypes were identified including H3N1 (2), H3N6 (3), H3N8 (4), H4N6 (6), H5N2 (3), H7N8 (1), and H10N6 (1) subtypes. All isolates were of low pathogenicity, as determined by the intravenous pathogenicity index of 0.00. For H5N2 and H7N8 isolates, the HA gene was sequenced and the phylogenetic analysis revealed possible ecologic connections of the Crimea region with AI viruses from Siberia and Europe. No influenza A isolates were recovered from other Anseriformes (diving ducks [two species of pochards] and graylag geese), Columbiformes (collared doves), Gruiformes (coot), and Galliformes (gray partridges).

AB The potential of low pathogenicity (LP) avian influenza virus (AIV) isolates of wild bird origin to establish infection in commercial turkeys and broiler chickens was studied. Isolates, representing subtypes H5N1, H7N3, H6N2, and H3N6, were recovered in 2005 and 2006 from waterfowl and shorebirds in the Delmarva Peninsula region of the east coast of the United States. The LP AIV isolates were not pathogenic for 2-wk-old meat-type turkeys and broiler chickens. No mortality, clinical signs, or gross lesions were observed following intratracheal and conjunctival sac routes of exposures with 10(6.0) EID50 (embryo infectious dose) per bird. Isolates resulting in an established infection based on virus isolation were: A/mallard/Maryland/1159/2006 (H5N1) in the upper respiratory tract of turkeys; A/mallard/Delaware/418/2005 (H7N3) in the upper respiratory and intestinal tracts of turkeys and chickens; and A/shorebird-environment/Delaware/251/2005 (H3N6) in the upper respiratory and intestinal tracts of chickens. Infections were also confirmed by production of AIV-specific serum antibodies detected by hemagglutination inhibition.

Better resolution of carbon fluxes mediated by deep microbes requires further testing on the validity of conversion factors. Archaea, especially marine Crenarchaeota Group I, are abundant in deep waters where they can fix dissolved inorganic carbon. Viruses appear to be important in the microbial loop in deep waters, displaying remarkably high virus to prokaryote abundance ratios in some oceanic regions. Sequencing of 18S rRNA genes revealed a tremendous diversity of small-sized protists in bathypelagic waters. Abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates decrease with depth more steeply than prokaryotes; nonetheless, data indicated that HNF consumed half of prokaryote production in the bathypelagic zone. Aggregates are important habitats for deep-water microbes, which produce more extracellular enzymes (on a per-cell basis) than surface communities. The theory of marine gel formation provides a framework to unravel complex interactions between microbes and organic polymers. Recent data on the effects of hydrostatic pressure on microbial activities indicate that bathypelagic microbial activity is generally higher under in situ pressure conditions than at atmospheric pressures. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed a remarkable diversity of Bacteria in the bathypelagic ocean. Metagenomics and comparative genomics of piezophiles reveal not only the high diversity of deep sea microbes but also specific functional attributes of these piezophilic microbes, interpreted as an adaptation to the deep water environment. Taken together, the data compiled on bathypelagic microbes indicate that, despite high-pressure and low-temperature conditions, microbes in the bathypelagic ocean dynamically interact with complex mixtures of organic matter, responding to changes in the ocean's biogeochemical state.

AB Aims:
   This study aims to investigate the ecology of coliphages, an important microbial pollution indicator. Specifically, our experiments address (i) the ability of environmental Escherichia coli (E. coli) to serve as hosts for coliphage replication, and (ii) the temporal and spatial distribution of coliphages in coastal waters.
   Methods and Results:
   Water samples from three locations in California's Newport Bay watershed were tested for the presence of coliphages every 2 weeks for an entire year. A total of nine E. coli strains isolated from various sources served as hosts for coliphage detection. Coliphage occurrence was significantly different between freshwater, estuarine and coastal locations and correlated with water temperature, salinity and rainfall in the watershed. The coliphages isolated on the environmental hosts had a broad host-range relative to the coliphages isolated on an E. coli strain from sewage and a US EPA recommended strain for coliphage detection.
   Conclusions:
   Coliphage occurrence was related to the temperature, rainfall and salinity within the bay. The adaptation to a broad host-range may enable the proliferation of coliphages in the aquatic environment.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   Understanding the seasonal variation of phages is useful for establishing a background level of coliphage presence in coastal waters. The broad host-range of coliphages isolated on the environmental E. coli host calls for investigation of coliphage replication in the aquatic environment.

AB Salmonella is one of the leading causes of human foodborne illness and is associated with swine production. Bacteriophages are naturally occurring viruses that prey on bacteria and have been suggested as a potential intervention strategy to reduce Salmonella levels in food animals on the farm and in the lairage period. If phages are to be used to improve food safety, then we must understand the incidence and natural ecology of both phages and their hosts in the intestinal environment. This study investigates the incidence of phages that are active against Salmonella spp. in the feces of commercial finishing swine. Fecal samples (n = 60) were collected from each of 10 commercial swine finishing operations. Samples were collected from 10 randomly selected pens throughout each operation; a total of 600 fecal samples were collected. Salmonella spp. were found in 7.3% (44/600) of the fecal samples. Bacteriophages were isolated from fecal samples through two parallel methods: (1) initial enrichment in Salmonella Typhimurium; (2) initial enrichment in Escherichia coli B (an indicator strain), followed by direct spot testing against Salmonella Typhimurium. Bacteriophages active against Salmonella Typhimurium were isolated from 1% (6/600) of the individual fecal samples when initially enriched in Salmonella Typhimurium, but E. coli B-killing phages were isolated from 48.3% (290/600) of the fecal samples and only two of these phages infected Salmonella Typhimurium on secondary plating. Collectively, our results indicate that bacteriophages are widespread in commercial swine, but those capable of killing Salmonella Typhimurium may be present at relatively low population levels. These results indicate that phages (predator) populations may vary along with Salmonella (prey) populations; and that phages could potentially be used as a food safety pathogen reduction strategy in swine.

AB Wild aquatic birds in the Orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are the main reservoir hosts perpetuating the genetic pool of all influenza A viruses, including pandemic viruses. High viral loads in feces of infected birds permit a fecal-oral route of transmission. Numerous studies have reported the isolation of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) from surface water at aquatic bird habitats. These isolations indicate aquatic environments have an important role in the transmission of AIV among wild aquatic birds. However, the progressive dilution of infectious feces in water could decrease the likelihood of virus/host interactions. To evaluate whether alternate mechanisms facilitate AIV transmission in aquatic bird populations, we investigated whether the preen oil gland secretions by which all aquatic birds make their feathers waterproof could support a natural mechanism that concentrates AIVs from water onto birds' bodies, thus, representing a possible source of infection by preening activity. We consistently detected both viral RNA and infectious AIVs on swabs of preened feathers of 345 wild mallards by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus-isolation (VI) assays. Additionally, in two laboratory experiments using a quantitative real-time (qR) RT-PCR assay, we demonstrated that feather samples (n=5) and cotton swabs (n = 24) experimentally impregnated with preen oil, when soaked in AIV-contaminated waters, attracted and concentrated AIVs on their surfaces. The data presented herein provide information that expands our understanding of AIV ecology in the wild bird reservoir system.

AB Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is an arbovirus of public health importance in the genus Flavivirus, a group of positive sense RNA viruses. The NS3 gene has a high level of substitutions and is phylogenetically informative. Likewise, substitutions in the envelope region have been postulated to enable viruses to subvert immune responses. Analysis of these genes among isolates from positive mosquitoes collected in Louisiana illustrates the variation present in the regions and provides improved insight to a phylogenetic model. Employing a GIS eco-regionalization method, we hypothesized that WNV pool positivity was correlated with regional environmental characteristics. Further, we postulated that the phylogenetic delineations would be associated with variations in regional environmental conditions.
   Results: Type of regional land cover was a significant effect (p < 0.0001) in the positive pool prediction, indicating that there is an ecological component driving WNV activity. Additionally, month of collection was significant (p < 0.0001); and thus there is a temporal component that contributes to the probability of getting a positive mosquito pool. All virus isolates are of the WNV 2002 lineage. There appears to be some diversity within both forested and wetland areas; and the possibility of a distinct clade in the wetland samples.
   Conclusions: The phylogenetic analysis shows that there has been no reversion in Louisiana from the 2002 lineage which replaced the originally introduced strain. Our pool positivity model serves as a basis for future testing, and could direct mosquito control and surveillance efforts. Understanding how land cover and regional ecology effects mosquito pool positivity will greatly help focus mosquito abatement efforts. This would especially help in areas where abatement programs are limited due to either funding or man power. Moreover, understanding how regional environments drive phylogenetic variation will lead to a greater understanding of the interactions between ecology and disease prevalence.

AB Similar to virtually all components of natural environments, microbial systems are inherently complex and dynamic. Advances in cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided a route to study microbial consortia in their natural surroundings and to begin resolving the community structure, dominant metabolic processes and inter-organism interactions. However, the utility of these methods generally scales inversely with community complexity. By applying genomics-enabled methods to the study of natural microbial communities with reduced levels of species richness, a relatively comprehensive understanding of the metabolic networks and evolutionary processes within these communities can be attained. In such well-defined model systems, it is also possible to link emergent ecological patterns to their molecular and evolutionary underpinnings, facilitating construction of predictive ecosystem models. In this study, we review over a decade of research on one such system-acid mine drainage biofilm communities. We discuss the value and limitations of tractable model microbial communities in developing molecular methods for microbial ecology and in uncovering principles that may explain behavior in more complex systems.

AB Changes in the microbial community composition of a full-scale membrane bioreactor treating industrial wastewater were studied over a period of 462 days using a series of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. Frequent changes in the relative abundance of specific taxonomic groups were observed, which could not be explained by changes in the reactor's conditions or wastewater composition. Phage activity was proposed to drive some of the observed changes. Bacterial hosts were isolated from a biomass sample obtained towards the end of the study period, and specific phage counts were carried out for some of the isolated hosts using stored frozen biomass samples as the phage inocula. Plaque-forming unit concentrations were shown to change frequently over the study period, in correlation with changes in the relative abundance of taxonomic groups closely related by 16S rRNA gene sequence to the isolated strains. Quantitative PCR was used to verify changes in the abundance of a taxonomic group closely related to one of the isolated hosts, showing good agreement with the changes in relative abundance in the clone libraries of that group. The emerging pattern was consistent with the 'killing the winner' hypothesis, although alternative interaction mechanisms could not be ruled out. This is the first time that phage-host interactions in a complex microbial community are demonstrated over an extended period, and possibly the first in situ demonstration of 'killing the winner' stochastic behavior.

AB Environmental samples have been analysed for viruses in metagenomic studies, but these studies have not linked individual viruses to their hosts. We designed a strategy to isolate double-stranded RNA, a hallmark of RNA virus infection, from individual plants and convert this to cDNA with a unique four nucleotide Tag at each end. Using 96 different Tags allowed us to pool samples and still retain the link to the original sample. We then analysed the sequence of pooled samples using massively parallel sequencing with Roche 454 pyrosequencing such that 384 samples could be assessed per picotiter plate. Using this method we have been able to analyse thousands of plants, and we have discovered several thousand new plant viruses, all linked to their specific plant hosts. Here we describe the method in detail, including the results and analysis for eight pools of samples. This technology will be extremely useful in understanding the full scope of plant virus biodiversity.

AB We report the genetic characterization of H6 avian influenza (Al) viruses isolated from domestic ducks and wild birds in Korea between April 2008 and April 2009. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the H6N1 viruses of wild birds and domestic ducks were of the same genotype (K-1) and were similar to the H6N1 virus isolated from a live poultry market in 2003, as six of the eight gene segments of those viruses had a common source. However, the H6N2 viruses of domestic poultry were separated into four genotypes (K-2a, K-2b, K-2c and K-2d) by at least a triple reassortment between influenza viruses of low pathogenicity from Korean poultry (H9N2 and H3N2) and viruses from aquatic birds. In an experimental infection of animals, certain H6 Al viruses replicated well in chickens and mice without pre-adaptation, indicating that H6 virus pathogenicity has the potential to be altered due to multiple reassortments, and that these reassortments could result in interspecies transmission to mammals.

AB Viruses were earlier found to be 10-fold more abundant than prokaryotes in deep granitic groundwater at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL). Using a most probable number (MPN) method, 8-30 000 cells of sulphate-reducing bacteria per ml were found in groundwater from seven boreholes at the Aspo HRL. The content of lytic phages infecting the indigenous bacterium Desulfovibrio aespoeensis in Aspo groundwater was analysed using the MPN technique for phages. In four of 10 boreholes, 0.2-80 phages per ml were found at depths of 342-450 m. Isolates of lytic phages were made from five cultures. Using transmission electron microscopy, these were characterized and found to be in the Podoviridae morphology group. The isolated phages were further analysed regarding host range and were found not to infect five other species of Desulfovibrio or 10 Desulfovibrio isolates with up to 99.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to D. aespoeensis. To further analyse phage-host interactions, using a direct count method, growth of the phages and their host was followed in batch cultures, and the viral burst size was calculated to be similar to 170 phages per lytic event, after a latent period of similar to 70 h. When surviving cells from infected D. aespoeensis batch cultures were inoculated into new cultures and reinfected, immunity to the phages was found. The parasite-prey system found implies that viruses are important for microbial ecosystem diversity and activity, and for microbial numbers in deep subsurface groundwater.

AB Aims:
   To evaluate the phage diversity in the environment of a dairy industry which manufactures a product fermented with a probiotic strain of Lactobacillus paracasei.
   Methods and Results:
   Twenty-two Lact. paracasei phages were isolated from an industrial plant that manufactures a probiotic dairy product. Among them, six phages were selected based on restriction profiles, and two phages because of their notable thermal resistance during sample processing. Their morphology, host range, calcium dependency and thermal resistance were investigated. All phages belonged to the Siphoviridae family (B1 morphotype), were specific for Lact. casei and paracasei strains showing identical host spectrum, and only one phage was independent of calcium for completing its lytic cycle. Some of the phages showed an extraordinary thermal resistance and were protected by a commercial medium and milk.
   Conclusions:
   Phage diversity in a probiotic product manufacture was generated to a similar or greater extent than during traditional yogurt or cheese making.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   This work emphasizes probiotic phage infections as a new ecological situation beyond yogurt or cheese manufactures, where the balanced coexistence between phages and strains should be directed toward a favourable state, thus achieving a successful fermentation.

AB We characterized an influenza virus isolated from a great white pelican in Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of its gene segments belonged to the Eurasian lineage and that they appear to have evolved in distinct geographical regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, suggesting reassortment of virus genes maintained in wild aquatic birds whose flyways overlap across these continents. It is notable that this virus might possess some genes of the same origin as those of highly pathogenic H7 and H5 viruses isolated in Eurasia. The present study underscores the need for continued monitoring of avian influenza viruses in Eurasia and Africa.

AB The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus emerged from China in 1996 and has spread across Eurasia and Africa, with a continuous stream of new cases of human infection appearing since the first large-scale outbreak among migratory birds at Qinghai Lake. The role of wild birds, which are the natural reservoirs for the virus, in the epidemiology of the H5N1 virus has raised great public health concern, but their role in the spread of the virus within the natural ecosystem of free-ranging terrestrial wild mammals remains unclear. In this study, we investigated H5N1 virus infection in wild pikas in an attempt to trace the circulation of the virus. Seroepidemiological surveys confirmed a natural H5N1 virus infection of wild pikas in their native environment. The hemagglutination gene of the H5N1 virus isolated from pikas reveals two distinct evolutionary clades, a mixed/Vietnam H5N1 virus sublineage (MV-like pika virus) and a wild bird Qinghai (QH)like H5N1 virus sublineage (QH-like pika virus). The amino acid residue (glutamic acid) at position 627 encoded by the PB2 gene of the MV-like pika virus was different from that of the QH-like pika virus; the residue of the MV-like pika virus was the same as that of the goose H5N1 virus (A/GS/Guangdong [GD]/1/96). Further, we discovered that in contrast to the MV-like pika virus, which is nonpathogenic to mice, the QH-like pika virus is highly pathogenic. To mimic the virus infection of pikas, we intranasally inoculated rabbits, a species closely related to pikas, with the H5N1 virus of pika origin. Our findings first demonstrate that wild pikas are mammalian hosts exposed to H5N1 subtype avian influenza viruses in the natural ecosystem and also imply a potential transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus from wild mammals into domestic mammalian hosts and humans.

AB Careful selection and observance of standard field and laboratory protocols are critical for successful detection and characterization of avian influenza viruses (AIV) from wild birds. Cloacal swabs were collected from hunter-killed or nesting waterfowl and shorebirds from wildlife refuges in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida during 2006 to 2008. Swab samples were inoculated into embryonated eggs followed by hemagglutination (HA) test to determine the presence of hemagglutinating agents. Antigen capture-ELISA (AC-ELISA) and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RRT-PCR) were used to detect AIV from both allantoic fluids (AF) and swab specimens of HA-positive samples. Hemagglutination inhibition test was used to detect Newcastle disease virus, another hemagglutinating virus common in wild birds. The HA-positive AF were sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory for subtyping of the isolates. Out of 825 samples tested, 19 AIV and 3 avian paramyxovirus subtypes were identified by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. Without egg passage, AC-ELISA did not detect virus, whereas matrix gene of 13 AIV were detected using RRT-PCR. When testing was done on AF, 14 were positive for influenza A by AC-ELISA and 20 by RRT-PCR. Antigen capture-ELISA did not detect influenza A when the HA titer was lower than 125, whereas RRT-PCR detected AIV from AF with HA titer as low as 4. The highest isolation rate was from Florida, where out of 109 samples analyzed, 14 AIV were detected by RRT-PCR from AF. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was more sensitive, specific, and cost-effective than AC-ELISA. However, to avoid false-negative results, testing should be performed on AF and not directly from cloacal swabs. Our procedures to detect AIV directly from cloacal swabs need further optimization for improved sensitivity.

AB A novel cryptic plasmid, pMP1, from an environmental Vibrio vulnificus MP-4 isolated from Mai Po Nature Reserve in Hong Kong, has been characterized. The 7.6-kb plasmid had guanine-cytosine content of 40.03% and encoded four open reading frames (ORFs) with > 100 amino acids. The predicted protein of ORF1 contained 478 amino acids showing 29% identity and 50% similarity over 309 amino acids to the integrase of Vibrio cholerae phage VP2. ORF2 encoded a putative protein of 596 amino acids, which were 23% identity and 42% similarity over 455 amino acids to the tail tape measure protein TP901 of Chromohalobacter salexigens phage. ORF3 and ORF4 encoded putative proteins of 103 and 287 amino acids, respectively, but showed no homologies to any known proteins. Further experiments indicated that a 3.2-kb fragment from EcoRI digestion could self-replicate. Analysis indicated that a sequence upstream of ORF4 had the features characteristic of theta-type replicons: AT-rich region, six potential direct repeats (iterons) spaced approximately two DNA helical turn apart (about 23 bp), two copies of 9 bp dnaA boxes, three Dam methylation sites, and five inverted repeats. Complementation experiments confirmed that the protein encoded by ORF4 was required for plasmid replication. We propose that ORF4 encode a new type of Rep protein and pMP1 is a new type of theta plasmid.

AB Since wild ducks constitute a vital element in the epizootiology of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) as well as avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) and play a key role in the ecology and inter-species transmission of these viruses, it is crucial to elucidate the diversity and prevalence of these viruses within these bird populations. This report shows the presence, antigenic diversity, and inter-annual prevalence variations of AIVs in apparently healthy northern pintail (Anas acta) wintering in Japan. We also provide evidence that this host carries APMV-1: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and other haemagglutinating viruses. Composite samples (n = 2381) of fresh fecal materials were collected from northern pintail during November 2007-March 2008 at different locations of Tohoku district, main Island, Japan. We isolated 47 haemagglutinating viruses, out of which 25 were identified as AIVs, representing 9 combinations of 5 different haemagglutinin (HA) and 6 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes. Both H5 and H7 subtypes were identified and found to be low pathogenic. A further 11 viruses were grouped into APMV-1 (NDV). The rest of the viruses (n = 11) remained to be identified. Some of the HA subtypes and NA subtypes detected during the first season reoccurred in the second season, as well as some of their combinations; yet, several new subtypes and combinations appeared during the second season. These findings indicate that different subtypes of AIVs, NDV and other haemagglutinating viruses circulate subclinically in the pintail populations sampled. Pintails should be regarded, potentially, as important spreaders of AIVs and NDVs, particularly due to their extensively ramified flyways, which include various inter-continental routes.

AB Cooling towers provide a favorable environment for the proliferation of microorganisms. Cooling towers generate a biofilm and often aerosolize contaminated water, thereby increasing the risk of microorganism dissemination by human inhalation. This pathogen dissemination was first revealed by the epidemics of Legionnaires' disease that were directly related to the presence of cooling towers, and since then, the ecology of Legionella pneumophila has been well studied. Each country has specific standards regarding the acceptable amount of microorganisms in cooling tower systems. However, those standards typically only concern L pneumophila, even though many other microorganisms can also be isolated from cooling towers, including protozoa, bacteria and viruses. Microbiological control of the cooling tower system can be principally achieved by chemical treatments and also by improving the system's construction. Several new treatments are being studied to improve the efficiency of disinfection. However, as most of these treatments continue to focus solely on L. pneumophila, reports of other types of pathogens continue to increase. Therefore, how their dissemination affects the human populous health should be addressed now.

AB Viruses are ubiquitous in the sea and appear to outnumber all other forms of marine life by at least an order of magnitude. Through selective infection, viruses influence nutrient cycling, community structure, and evolution in the ocean. Over the past 20 years we have learned a great deal about the diversity and ecology of the viruses that constitute the marine virioplankton, but until recently the emphasis has been on DNA viruses. Along with expanding knowledge about RNA viruses that infect important marine animals, recent isolations of RNA viruses that infect single-celled eukaryotes and molecular analyses of the RNA virioplankton have revealed that marine RNA viruses are novel, widespread, and genetically diverse. Discoveries in marine RNA virology are broadening our understanding of the biology, ecology, and evolution of viruses, and the epidemiology of viral diseases, but there is still much that we need to learn about the ecology and diversity of RNA viruses before we can fully appreciate their contributions to the dynamics of marine ecosystems. As a step toward making sense of how RNA viruses contribute to the extraordinary viral diversity in the sea, we summarize in this review what is currently known about RNA viruses that infect marine organisms.

AB Our previous study indicated that the diversity of the major capsid gene (g23) of T4-type bacteriophages (phages) of Novosphingobium and Sphingomonas strains isolated from the floodwater of a Japanese paddy field is comparable to those of the clones obtained from other Japanese paddy fields. For more strict comparison of the diversity, this study examined g23 sequences between Novosphingobium and Sphingonionas phages and phage communities in the identical floodwater of a Japanese paddy field. The clones were obtained by applying g23-specific primers to DNA extracted from the floodwaters. Many 23 clones in the floodwater were grouped into the same clusters of Paddy Groups I-VI with g23 genes of Novosphingobium/Sphingomonas phages with some clones belonging to an additional cluster. In addition, tile remaining clones belonged to the clusters of marine clones and T4-type enterophages. These findings indicate that tile g23 genes in tile floodwater are more diversified than those of Novosphingobium/Sphingomonas phages including g23 genes closely related to the genes of enterophages and marine origins.

AB Bacterlophages (phages) are the viruses of bacteria and the study of phage biology can be differentiated, roughly, into molecular, environmental, evolutionary, ecological, and applied aspects. While for much of the past fifty-plus years molecular and then applied aspects have dominated the field, more recently environmental concerns, especially the phage impact on biogeochemical cycles, have driven an increase in the appreciation of phage ecology. Over approximately the same time frame, decreasing sequencing costs have combined with phage molecular characterization to give rise to an inescapable consideration of phage comparative genomics. That, along with environmental metagenomics, has stimulated, especially among molecular biologists, a more general interest in phage evolutionary biology. However, while reviews of phage ecology have become exceedingly common, overviews of phage evolutionary biology are comparatively rare, and broad considerations of phage evolutionary biology drawn from an ecological perspective rarer still. In this chapter I jump into this latter void, providing an overview of phage evolutionary biology as viewed from the perspective of phage-environment interactions, that is, from the perspective of phage ecology. This I do over five sections constituting (1) an introduction to phages and how, phenotypically, they can be differentiated into three basics types that correlate, more or less, with genomic size, that is, tailed (generally larger genomes), lipid-containing (medium-sized genomes), and single-stranded (small genomes); (2) a brief introduction to phage ecology as considered particularly from a classical ecological perspective; (3) an extended introduction to evolutionary biology as viewed from a phage and phage-ecological standpoint; (4) phage evolutionary ecology, that is, consideration of phage adaptations from the vantage of why, in terms of phage fitness, those adaptations may have evolved; and (5) phage evolutionary biology, including evolutionary ecology, as viewed from the perspective of phage genomics.

AB Soil viruses are potentially of great importance as they may influence the ecology and evolution of soil biological communities through both an ability to transfer genes from host to host and as a potential cause of microbial mortality. Despite this importance, the area of soil virology is understudied. Here, we report the isolation and preliminary characterisation of viruses from soils in the Dundee area of Scotland. Different virus morphotypes including tailed, polyhedral (spherical), rod shaped, filamentous and bacilliform particles were detected in the soil samples. An apparent predominance of small spherical and filamentous bacteriophages was observed, whereas tailed bacteriophages were significantly less abundant. In this report, we also present observations and characterisation of viruses from different soil functional domains surrounding wheat roots: rhizosheath, rhizosphere and bulk soil. In spite of the differences in abundance of bacterial communities in these domains, no significant variations in viral population structure in terms of morphology and abundance were found. Typically, there were approximately 1.1-1.2 x 10(9) virions g(-1) dry weight, implicating remarkable differences in virus-to-bacteria ratios in domains close to roots, rhizosphere and rhizosheath (approximately 0.27) and in bulk soil (approximately 4.68).

AB The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has elevated concerns about wild birds as virus hosts; however, little is known about the ecological and epidemiological factors of transmission by shorebirds. Here we summarize results for 2,773 shorebirds that were live-trapped oil the Pacific coast of the United States during 2006-2007 and tested for avian influenza virus using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation. As was the case throughout North America, HPAI H5N1 was not detected in shorebirds during this interval. Contrary to other wild bird groups, most notably waterfowl, the prevalence of even low pathogenicity virus among shorebirds in our study areas in California, Washington, and Alaska was extremely low (0.5%). Virus was detected by RT-PCR from four different species, including, Dunlin (Calidris alpina; N = 3), Western Sandpiper (C. mauri; N = 8), Long-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus scolopaceus; N = 1), and American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana; N = 1), With the detections in the latter three constituting the first published records for these birds. Based oil studies in the eastern United States, we expected, but did not detect (H-1 = 1.6, P = 0.21) elevated avian influenza prevalence among shorebirds during spring migration. Diagnostic tests, which were designed to evaluate testing and sampling methods, indicated poor functioning of traditional virus isolation methods and no improvement in detection likelihood by collecting oropharyngeal swabs in addition to cloacal swab samples for low pathogenicity viruses (Z(1) = 0.7, P = 0.48).

AB Even though at least 400 Listeria phages have been isolated from various sources, limited information is available on phages from the food processing plant environment. Phages in the processing plant environment may play critical roles in determining the Listeria population that becomes established in the plant. In this study, we pursued the isolation of Listeria-specific phages from environmental samples from four turkey processing plants in the United States. These environmental samples were also utilized to isolate Listeria spp. Twelve phages were isolated and classified into three groups in terms of their host range. Of these, nine (group 1) showed a wide host range, including multiple serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes, as well as other Listeria spp. (L. innocua, L. welshimeri, L. seeligeri, and L. ivanovii). The remaining phages mostly infected L. monocytogenes serotype 4b as well as L. innocua, L. ivanovii, and/or L. welshimeri. All but one of the strains of the serotype 4b complex (4b, 4d, 4e) from the processing plant environment could be readily infected by the wide-host-range phages isolated from the environment of the processing plants. However, many strains of other serotypes (1/2a [or 3a] and 1/2b [or 3b]), which represented the majority of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from the environmental samples, were resistant to infection by these phages. Experiments with two phageresistant strains showed reduced phage adsorption onto the host cells. These findings suggest that phage resistance may be an important component of the ecology of L. monocytogenes in the turkey processing plants.

AB Oceanic phages are critical components of the global ecosystem, where they play a role in microbial mortality and evolution. Our understanding of phage diversity is greatly limited by the lack of useful genetic diversity measures. Previous studies, focusing on myophages that infect the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus, have used the coliphage T4 portal-protein-encoding homologue, gene 20 (g20), as a diversity marker. These studies revealed 10 sequence clusters, 9 oceanic and 1 freshwater, where only 3 contained cultured representatives. We sequenced g20 from 38 marine myophages isolated using a diversity of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus hosts to see if any would fall into the clusters that lacked cultured representatives. On the contrary, all fell into the three clusters that already contained sequences from cultured phages. Further, there was no obvious relationship between host of isolation, or host range, and g20 sequence similarity. We next expanded our analyses to all available g20 sequences (769 sequences), which include PCR amplicons from wild uncultured phages, non-PCR amplified sequences identified in the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) metagenomic database, as well as sequences from cultured phages, to evaluate the relationship between g20 sequence clusters and habitat features from which the phage sequences were isolated. Even in this meta-data set, very few sequences fell into the sequence clusters without cultured representatives, suggesting that the latter are very rare, or sequencing artefacts. In contrast, sequences most similar to the culture-containing clusters, the freshwater cluster and two novel clusters, were more highly represented, with one particular culture-containing cluster representing the dominant g20 genotype in the unamplified GOS sequence data. Finally, while some g20 sequences were non-randomly distributed with respect to habitat, there were always numerous exceptions to general patterns, indicating that phage portal proteins are not good predictors of a phage's host or the habitat in which a particular phage may thrive.

AB Central to most theories that explain the diversity of life is the concept that organisms face trade-offs. Theoretical work has shown that the precise shape of a trade-off relationship affects evolutionary predictions. One common trade-off is that between competitive ability and resistance to predators, parasitoids, pathogens or herbivores. We used a microbial experimental system to elucidate the shape of the relationship between parasitoid resistance and competitive ability. For each of 86 bacteriophage-resistant isolates of the bacterium Escherichia coli B, we measured the degree of resistance to bacteriophage T2 (a viral parasitoid) and relative competitive ability in both the resource environment in which strains were isolated and in two alternate environments. We observed that environmental change can alter trade-off shape, and that different physiological mechanisms can lead to different trade-off shapes and different sensitivities to environmental change. These results highlight the important interaction between environment and trade-off shape in affecting ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

AB The Bacillus cereus group comprises a diverse array of non-pathogenic bacteria as well as pathogens Such as Bacillus thuringiensis. Their spores are found together in soil and leaves and are therefore likely to commonly interact within hosts. Mixed infections of pathogenic B. thuringiensis and non-pathogenic strains have been little Studied, despite their potential impact on biological control and the evolutionary ecology of virulence. Antibiotic secreting strains of B. cereus have been shown to be able to synergize B. thuringiensis (Bt) infections. We explored the ecology of these mixed infections more broadly in the diamondback moth (DBM). We tested whether antibiotic-expressing B. cereus can synergize Bt infections initiated with spores, investigated whether ingestion of antibiotic-expressing B. cereus had any consequences for the larval gut flora and whether synergistic interactions with B. cereus increase Bt reproduction. Ingestion of high-antibiotic secreting B. cereus synergized infections of B. thuringiensis in diamondback moth larvae, but at a lower level than previously reported. Coinfection also increased slightly the number of Bt spores found in cadavers. Culture independent analysis Of gut homogenates indicated that ingestion of an antibiotic-expressing strain of B. cereus reduced the abundance of the gut flora and led to gut communities being dominated bacteria with DGGE profiles very similar to pure B. cereus Cultures. Ingestion of B. cereus, regardless of genotype, reduced densities of an enteric isolate of Enterobacter sp. These findings support the hypothesis that antibiotic secretion in the gut synergizes B. thuringiensis infections by reducing the abundance of the commensal gut flora and facilitating invasion by bacteria in the B. cereus group.

AB Aim: To isolate viruses of specific heterotrophic bacterial strains from marine environments using a host addition/virus amplification protocol (HAVAP) for use in phage/host systems.
   Methods and Results: Bacteria-free seawater samples containing natural viruses assemblages were inoculated with a single laboratory grown bacterial host of interest in a nutrient-enriched [peptone, Fe(III) and yeast extract] seawater suspension. These conditions enhanced the replication of only those virus(s) capable of infecting the host bacterium. After incubation, free viruses were recovered at concentrations ranging 10(5)-10(10) infectious virus particles per ml of seawater. Using this approach, 15 viruses were isolated and represented 12 unique phage/host systems. Two of the hosts tested were infected by more than one virus.
   Conclusions: Isolation of high concentrations of specific viruses is possible even if their initial concentrations in native waters are low. This approach allows the recovery of phage/host systems that may not be numerically dominant.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This host enrichment protocol for virus detection and isolation is well-suited for aquatic viral ecology studies that require phage/host systems.

AB Viruses are arguably the simplest form of life yet they play a crucial role in regulating planetary processes. From shuttling genes to 'lubricating' microbial loop dynamics, viruses are integral in shaping microbial ecology. In every environment on Earth the role of viruses goes far beyond the simple infect-replicate-kill cycle. Their enormous abundance and seemingly infinite diversity provide the vital clues to the true function of viruses. New 'omic' approaches are now allowing researchers to gain extraordinary insights into virus diversity and inferred function, particularly within aquatic environments. The development of molecular markers and application of techniques including microarrays, metagenomic sequencing and proteomic analysis are now being applied to virus communities. Despite this shift towards culture-independent approaches it has proved difficult to derive useful information about infection strategies since so much of the sequence information has no database matches. Future advances will involve tools such as microarrays; to help determine the functionality of unknown genes. Sequence information should be considered as a starting point for asking questions and developing hypotheses about the role of viruses. It is an exciting new era for virus ecology and when used in combination with more traditional approaches, virus genomics will give us access to their ecological function on an unprecedented scale.

AB 1. Koi herpesvirus (KHV) disease, a lethal disease in carp and koi, has spread rapidly since the late 1990s. Only a few studies have focused on the ecology of KHV in natural freshwater environments, although characterization and the diagnosis of KHV disease have been intensively studied. This is mainly due to the lack of reliable detection methods for KHV in natural environments.
   2. Three different approaches have been used to detect KHV in fish samples: (i) isolation and identification of the virus using cultured cell lines; (ii) detection of viral DNA with target DNA amplification techniques; and (iii) detection of anti-KHV antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among these methods, DNA amplification techniques have become most popular because of their sensitivity and simplicity.
   3. In contrast to KHV detection in fish samples, detection of KHV from water and sediment samples has not been reported. This is the result of a lack of reliable KHV concentration methods for water and sediment samples, although methodology from public health and marine microbiology may be applicable to determine KHV concentration in such samples.
   4. Few reports have evaluated the environmental factors (e.g. temperature, UV irradiation) that affect the fate of KHV in water bodies. Mass mortality of wild carp caused by KHV infection would result in the removal of a large omnivorous fish from freshwater ecosystems and may thus alter community structure and ecosystem functioning.

   ANNOTATION
AB Algal viruses are considered ecologically important by affecting host population dynamics and nutrient flow in aquatic food webs. Members of the family Phycodnaviridae are also interesting due to their extraordinary genome size. Few algal viruses in the Phycodnaviridae family have been sequenced, and those that have been have few genes in common and low gene homology. It has hence been difficult to design general PCR primers that allow further studies of their ecology and diversity. In this study, we screened the nine type I core genes of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses for sequences suitable for designing a general set of primers. Sequence comparison between members of the Phycodnaviridae family, including three partly sequenced viruses infecting the prymnesiophyte Pyramimonas orientalis and the haptophytes Phaeocystis pouchetii and Chrysochromulina ericina (Pyramimonas orientalis virus 01B [PoV-01B], Phaeocystis pouchetii virus 01 [PpV-01], and Chrysochromulina ericina virus 01B [CeV-01B], respectively), revealed eight conserved regions in the major capsid protein (MCP). Two of these regions also showed conservation at the nucleotide level, and this allowed us to design degenerate PCR primers. The primers produced 347- to 518-bp amplicons when applied to lysates from algal viruses kept in culture and from natural viral communities. The aim of this work was to use the MCP as a proxy to infer phylogenetic relationships and genetic diversity among members of the Phycodnaviridae family and to determine the occurrence and diversity of this gene in natural viral communities. The results support the current legitimate genera in the Phycodnaviridae based on alga host species. However, while placing the mimivirus in close proximity to the type species, PBCV-1, of Phycodnaviridae along with the three new viruses assigned to the family (PoV-01B, PpV-01, and CeV-01B), the results also indicate that the coccolithoviruses and phaeoviruses are more diverged from this group. Phylogenetic analysis of amplicons from virus assemblages from Norwegian coastal waters as well as from isolated algal viruses revealed a cluster of viruses infecting members of the prymnesiophyte and prasinophyte alga divisions. Other distinct clusters were also identified, containing amplicons from this study as well as sequences retrieved from the Sargasso Sea metagenome. This shows that closely related sequences of this family are present at geographically distant locations within the marine environment.

AB A short overview of currently available studies on the ecology of viruses in running waters is provided. Additionally, a survey was conducted on the dynamics of both viruses and bacteria in an isolated floodplain segment of the Danube River and in the main channel near Vienna (Austria) during the hydrologically most dynamic phase (spring - summer). The study evaluates the differences between the main channel and the floodplain segment for suspended particle abundance and quality in relation to bacterial and viral parameters; both free-living forms and those attached to particles are examined. The hydrological disconnection of these two contrasting sampling sites influenced particle abundance and quality as well as the distribution of free-living vs. attached bacteria and viruses. The per-cell activity of bacteria attached to particles was significantly higher than that of the free-living fraction, particularly in the isolated water body. The abundance of bacteria and viruses on particles depended on particle quality (size). In the main channel, bacteria were significantly more abundant on surfaces (per mm(2)) of suspended matter > 5 mu m (aggregates with organic constituents) compared to particles < 5 mu m (mostly mineral grains). In the isolated water body, both bacteria and viruses were more abundant on the larger particles/aggregates. Data from both locations revealed a positive correlation between abundance of particles > 5 mu m and attached viruses; free-living viruses were less abundant at high > 5 mu m particle loads. Only in the isolated floodplain section was viral abundance positively influenced by elevated per-cell productivity of potential host bacteria. The results demonstrate that system variability on a relatively small topographical scale (within a river-floodplain system) has consequences for microbial life, including viruses.

AB To determine the genetic origins of novel H3 avian influenza viruses of chickens and ducks in Korea, genetic characterization of H3 avian influenza viruses isolated from live poultry markets and migratory aquatic birds in South Korea during 2004-2006 was conducted. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least four novel genotypes of H3N2 and two genotypes of H3N6 avian influenza viruses were co-circulating in backyard poultry of Korea. The viruses were reassortants between H9N2 viruses of Korean chickens and unknown influenza viruses of migratory birds. Genetic comparison of H3 viruses from live bird markets with those from wild bird isolates revealed that certain gene segments of wild bird isolates are related closely to those of Korean group H9N2 viruses isolated from live poultry markets in 2003. Furthermore, animal-challenge studies demonstrated that the pathogenicity of certain avian H3 influenza viruses was altered due to reassortment, leading to H3 avian influenza viruses in Korea that can potentially expand their host range to include mammals. These studies emphasize the continuing need to monitor backyard poultry at live poultry markets to better understand interspecies transmission and the emergence of novel influenza viruses that have the potential to infect humans.

AB Little is known about the ecology and evolution of avian influenza in the natural environment, despite how these affect the potential for transmission. Most work has focused on characterizing viruses isolated from hosts such as waterfowl, and there have also been several instances of isolation and detection from abiotic sources such as water and ice. We used RT-PCR to amplify and characterize the influenza virus sequences present in sediments of ponds that are used heavily by waterfowl. The detection rate of influenza virus was high (> 50 %). Characterization of the viruses present by sequencing part of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene showed that there is a diverse collection of viruses in these sediments. We sequenced 117 partial HA gene clones from 11 samples and detected four different HA subtypes (H3, H8, H11 and H12), with approximately 65% of clone sequences being unique. This culture-independent approach was also able to detect a virus subtype that was not found by sampling of birds in the same geographical region in the same year. Viruses were detected readily in the winter when the ponds were frozen, indicating that these sediments could be a year-to-year reservoir of viruses to infect birds using the ponds, although we have not shown that these viruses are viable. We demonstrate that this approach is a feasible and valuable way to assess the prevalence and diversity of viruses present in the environment, and can be a valuable complement to more difficult viral culturing in attempting to understand the ecology of influenza viruses.

AB Viruses play important roles in biogeochemical nutrient cycles and act as genomic reservoirs in marine and freshwater environments, the understanding of which brought about the so-called 'third age' of virus ecology in aquatic environments. Unfortunately, the third age is in oceanography and limnology and outside the soil world. The main reason why virus ecology in soils has shown less progress is that agronomical and epidemiological interests were the primary motivation of viral studies by soil microbiologists. In this review, past research on viruses in soils is summarized after the introduction of the ecological traits of viruses, which are the effects of viruses on beneficial bacteria and soil-borne plant pathogens, adsorption of viruses to soils, and soil factors affecting viral inactivation and survival in soils. Horizontal gene transfer (transduction) in soils is also reviewed. Second, the abundance of viruses and their roles in biogeochemical nutrient cycles are summarized in aquatic environments. Five to 25% of the carbon fixed by primary producers is estimated to enter into the microbial loop via virus-induced lysis at different trophic levels in aquatic environments. The diversity of virus communities in aquatic environments estimated from analyses of the frequency distribution of capsid sizes and the morphology of virus populations are reviewed, and recent findings on the genomic diversity of viruses and their roles as the greatest genomic reservoirs in aquatic environments follow in the subsequent section. Viral genomics is elucidating the viral diversity and phylogenetic relationships among viruses in different environments. As the soil environment is a more diverse habitat for viruses than aquatic environments, viruses in soils have great potential to play roles comparable in quantity, which are unique in quality, to those in aquatic environments. Therefore, the potentiality and characteristics of viruses in soils are discussed in the final section for future research on virus ecology in soils from the viewpoints of biogeochemistry and genomic diversity. Synecological approaches to viruses in soils may open up a new era of soil virus ecology.

AB The genus Chaetoceros (Bacillariophyceae) is the dominant diatom in the world's oceans. Various physical, chemical and biological factors affect depletion of diatom populations, for which the importance of viruses as a potential mortality source has only recently been found. We isolated and characterized a new Chaetoceros-infecting virus causing the lysis of the cosmopolitan species C. debilis Cleve. The virus infectious for C. debilis was isolated from both water and sediment samples collected in western Japan. We show the physiologic, morphologic and genomic characteristics of one virus clone among many isolates. We first described the C. debilis DNA virus (Cdeb-DNAV), a 30 nm icosahedral virus accumulating in the cytoplasm of C. debilis. Host specificity of CdebDNAV is strain-specific and its infectivity is stably maintained through a wide temperature range (between 20 and -196 degrees C). The latent period and the burst size were estimated to be 12 to 24 h and 55 infectious units per host cell, respectively. CdebDNAV harbors a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome whose structure is unknown. Sequence comparisons showed that the partial sequence of CdebDNAV is highly similar (E value = 10(-56)) to the putative replicase gene of the C. salsugineum nuclear inclusion virus (CsNIV) that harbors a covalently closed circular, partially double-stranded ssDNA genome. This discovery of CdebDNAV may aid in further understanding the ecological dynamics of C. debilis population blooms in nature.

AB Avian influenza infections by high and low pathogenicity H7 influenza viruses have caused several outbreaks in European poultry in recent years, also resulting in human infections. Although in some cases the source of H7 strains from domestic poultry was shown to be the viruses circulating in the wild bird reservoir, a thorough characterization of the entire genome of H7 viruses from both wild and domestic Eurasian birds, and their evolutionary relationships, has not been conducted. In our study, we have analysed low pathogenicity H7 influenza strains isolated from wild and domestic ducks in Italy and southern China and compared them with those from reared terrestrial poultry such as chicken and turkey. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the H7 haemagglutinin genes were all closely related to each other, whereas the remaining genes could be divided into two or more phylogenetic groups. Almost each year different H7 reassortant viruses were identified and in at least two different years more than one H7 genotype co-circulated. A recent precursor in wild waterfowl was identified for most of the gene segments of terrestrial poultry viruses. Our data suggest that reassortment allows avian influenza viruses, in their natural reservoir, to increase their genetic diversity. In turn this might help avian influenza viruses colonize a wider range of hosts, including domestic poultry.

AB Outbreaks of acute hepatitis E, associated with consumption of contaminated drinking water, are frequent in India. Sewage is a major source for contamination of surface water. Data on the presence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in sewage in India are limited. The aim of this study was to look for the presence of HEV RNA in concentrates of sewage specimens collected from a major open sewage drain in Lucknow, India during August 2004 to July 2006, by the polymerase chain reaction, using primers specific for human HEV (genotype 1) or Indian swine HEV (genotype 4). Of the 192 sewage specimens tested, 79 (41%) showed presence of human HEV RNA. The positivity rate was higher during the second year (52/103 [51%]) than during the first year (27/89 [30%]; P=0.005). The seasonal pattern of HEV RNA positivity was as follows: winter months (November to February): 28 of 61 (46%); summer months (March to June): 36 of 66 (55%); and, monsoon months (July to October) 15 of 65 (23%). There was no reported outbreak of hepatitis E in the city during the study period. Swine HEV RNA was not detected in any of the 69 specimens tested. Repeat testing confirmed the reproducibility of the results. In addition, nucleic acid sequencing of six sewage isolates showed that these belonged to HEV genotype 1. The study suggests that HEV infection and fecal viral excretion may be common in HEV-endemic regions throughout the year even during non-epidemic periods.

AB Viruses are the largest reservoir of genetic material on the planet, yet little is known about the population dynamics of any virus within its natural environment. Over a 2-year period, we monitored the diversity of two archaeal viruses found in hot springs within Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Both temporal phylogeny and neutral biodiversity models reveal that virus diversity in these local environments is not being maintained by mutation but rather by high rates of immigration from a globally distributed metacommunity. These results indicate that geographically isolated hot springs are readily able to exchange viruses. The importance of virus movement is supported by the detection of virus particles in air samples collected over YNP hot springs and by their detection in metacommunity sequencing projects conducted in the Sargasso Sea. Rapid rates of virus movement are not expected to be unique to these archaeal viruses but rather a common feature among virus metacommunities. The finding that virus immigration rather than mutation can dominate community structure has significant implications for understanding virus circulation and the role that viruses play in ecology and evolution by providing a reservoir of mobile genetic material.

AB In view of various studies looking for the merit of coliphages as indicators of water pollution with viruses originating from faecal material, a small agricultural community (population of approximately 1500 inhabitants of all ages, 2-3 km from Haifa) was selected in order to understand these bacteriophage ecology (F-RNA and somatic coliphages) in its sewer and oxidation pond system. Along the sewer lines, it was possible to isolate constantly both bacteriophage types (F-RNA and somatic coliphages) at 10(2)-10(4) plaque-forming units (pfu) ml(-1). The average numbers of somatic and F-RNA phages isolated from oxidation pond were 10(3)-10(4) pfu ml(-1); however, somatic coliphages were undetectable for several months (April-August). Significant high correlation (0.944 < R-2 < 0.99) was found between increased anionic detergent concentrations and F-RNA coliphage numbers. Infants less than 1 year old excreted both phage types and few only F-RNA coliphages (at high numbers > 10(5) pfu g(-1)) for up to 1 year. The excretion of F-RNA coliphages was highly linked to Escherichia coli F+ harborage in the intestinal track as found in their faecal content. Finally, three bacterial hosts E. coli F+, F- and CN13 tested for survivability in sewage filtrate revealed that E. coli F+ had the highest survivability under these conditions. Presence of somatic and F male-specific phages in sewer lines of a small community are influenced by several factors such as: anionic detergents, nutrients, temperature, source (mainly infants), shedding and survival capability of the host strain. Better understanding of coliphages ecology in sewer systems can enhance our evaluation of these proposed indicator/index microorganisms used in tracking environmental pollution of water, soil and crop contamination with faecal material containing enteric viruses.

AB Aims: The termite gut microbiota can include a variety of micro-organisms from the three domains: Bacteria, Archaea and Eucarya. The bacterial groups from the gut systems are mainly affiliated to the proteobacteria, the Gram-positive groups Bacterioiodes/Flavobacterium branch and the spirochetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. However, culture independent molecular studies have revealed that the majority of these microbial gut symbionts have not yet been cultured, including actinobacterial clusters associated with termite guts. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to selectively isolate the actinofloral layers of gut associated microflora of the Coptotermes lacteus (Froggatt) species located at the Sunshine Coast Region of Queensland, Australia to increase our knowledge on the diversity of actinobacterial taxa present in the termite guts.
   Methods and Results: Actinofloral layers associated with the guts of the wood-eating subterranean termite C. lacteus were investigated by exploiting the phage susceptibility of different gut associated bacteria which impede the growth of actinomycetes on isolation plates. These unwanted microbial taxa were removed by exposing the gut contents to polyvalent bacteriophages specifically targeting different background bacterial taxa and after their removal from the isolation plates previously undetected and novel actinomycetes were successfully cultured from the gut samples.
   Conclusions: Use of bacteriophages as a means of selective pressure successfully revealed the presence of novel actinomycete species within the guts of C. lacteus.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Molecular ecology has undoubtedly revealed the fascinating diversity of micro-organisms, which cannot be cultured. However, these advances in the field still have not provided the ability to detect and isolate micro-organisms effectively from their ecological niches. Accordingly, studies like the one described here have importance in increasing the chances of uncultured taxa to be isolated to complement molecular microbial ecological efforts towards the establishment of an understanding on the diversity of termite gut microflora.

AB Natural hypersaline waters are widely distributed around the globe, as both continental surface waters and sea floor lakes, the latter being maintained by the large density difference between the hypersaline and overlying marine water. Owing to the extreme salt concentrations, close to or at saturation (approximately 35%, w/v), such waters might be expected to be devoid of life but, in fact, maintain dense populations of microbes. The majority of these microorganisms are halophilic prokaryotes belonging to the Domain Archaea, 'haloarchaea'. Viruses infecting haloarchaea are a vital part of hypersaline ecosystems, in many circumstances outnumbering cells by 10-100-fold. However, few of these 'haloviruses' have been isolated and even fewer have been characterised in molecular detail. In this review, we explore the methods used by haloviruses to replicate within their hosts and consider the implications of haloviral-haloarchaeal interactions for salt lake ecology.

AB Background: The origin and evolution of viruses is currently a heavily discussed issue. One element in this discussion is the innate viral "self" concept, which suggests that viral structures and functions can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of genetic determinants that are inherited from a viral ancestor and encode the viral "self". The second group consists of another set of structures and functions, the "nonself", which is interchangeable between different viruses and can be obtained via lateral gene transfer. Comparing the structures and sequences of the "self" elements, we have proposed that viruses can be grouped into lineages regardless of which domain of life (bacteria, archaea, eukarya) they infect. It has also been suggested that viruses are ancient and possibly predate modern cells.
   Results: Here we identified thirteen putative prophages (viral genomes integrated into bacterial chromosome) closely related to the virulent icosahedral tailless lipid-containing bacteriophage PM2. Using the comparative genomics approach, we present evidence to support the viral "self" hypothesis and divide genes of the bacteriophage PM2 and related prophages into "self" and "nonself" categories.
   Conclusion: We show here that the previously proposed most conserved viral "self" determinants, the major coat protein and the packaging ATPase, were the only proteins that could be recognized in all detected corticoviral elements. We also argue here that the genes needed for viral genome replication, as well as for host cell lysis, belong to the "nonself" category of genes.
   Furthermore, we suggest that abundance of PM2-like viruses in the aquatic environment as well as their importance in the ecology of aquatic microorganisms might have been underestimated.

AB Prior to the ongoing Asian H5N1 epizootic, it was believed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was a disease of domesticated birds and that wild birds could act on ly as reservoirs for the low pathogenic form (LPAI) of these viruses. The unprecedented situation in Asia during 2004 and 2005 revealed spillover of HPAI H5N1 infection to naive populations of wild birds. To date the role wild birds may play in the ecology and epizootiology of HPAI H5NI appears very different to that in other HPAI epizootics, and is far from being completely understood. Recent outbreaks in Russia and Central Asia, Europe, and Africa indicate transboundary spread of HPAI H5N1. Isolation of the virus from wild birds in Eurasia led to speculation that wild birds may play a role in introducing and possibly seconclarily spreading the infection to disease-free areas. Several diagnostic methodologies are available to detect avian influenza infection. Generation of reliable data requires the most appropriate diagnostic approach specific to the aim of the surveillance program and ecology of the virus in both the target population and the environment. Harmonized diagnostic strategies for detection of HPAI H5N1. must be developed and followed worldwide in order to make results comparable and useful to the international scientific community. The OIE/FAO Reference Laboratory in Padova, Italy is involved in extensive surveillance of wild birds sampled in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Using results of this program, we developed a set of diagnostic guidelines that could be a basis for a harmonized approach by diagnostic laboratories.

AB Sponges are the most simple and primitive metazoans, yet they have various biological and ecological properties that make them an influential component of coral-reef ecosystems. Marine sponges provide refuge for many small invertebrates and are critical to benthic-pelagic coupling across a wide range of habitats. Reports of sponge disease have increased dramatically in recent years with sponge populations decimated throughout the Mediterranean and Caribbean. Reports also suggest an increased prevalence of sponge disease in Papua New Guinea, the Great Barrier Reef and in the reefs of Cozumel, Mexico. These epidemics can have severe impacts on the survival of sponge populations, the ecology of the reef and the fate of associated marine invertebrates. Despite the ecological and commercial importance of sponges, the understanding of sponge disease is limited. There has generally been a failure to isolate and identify the causative agents of sponge disease, with only one case confirming Koch's postulates and identifying a novel Alphaproteobacteria strain as the primary pathogen. Other potential disease agents include fungi, viruses, cyanobacteria and bacterial strains within the Bacillus and Pseudomonas genera. There is some evidence for correlations between sponge disease and environmental factors such as climate change and urban/agricultural runoff. This review summarizes the occurrence of sponge disease, describes the syndromes identified thus far, explores potential linkages with environmental change and proposes a strategy for future research towards better management of sponge disease outbreaks.

AB Although extensive data exist on avian influenza in wild birds in North America, limited information is available from elsewhere, including Europe. Here, molecular diagnostic tools were employed for high-throughput surveillance of migratory birds, as an alternative to classical labor-intensive methods of virus isolation in eggs. This study included 36,809 samples from 323 bird species belonging to 18 orders, of which only 25 species of three orders were positive for influenza A virus. Information on species, locations, and timing is provided for all samples tested. Seven previously unknown host species for avian influenza virus were identified: barnacle goose, bean goose, brent goose, pink-footed goose, bewick's swan, common gull, and guillemot. Dabbling ducks were more frequently infected than other ducks and Anseriformes; this distinction was probably related to bird behavior rather than population sizes. Waders did not appear to play a role in the epidemiology of avian influenza in Europe, in contrast to the Americas. The high virus prevalence in ducks in Europe in spring as compared with North America could explain the differences in virus-host ecology between these continents. Most influenza A virus subtypes were detected in ducks, but H13 and H16 subtypes were detected primarily in gulls. Viruses of subtype H6 were more promiscuous in host range than other subtypes. Temporal and spatial variation in influenza virus prevalence in wild birds was observed, with influenza A virus prevalence varying by sampling location; this is probably related to migration patterns from northeast to southwest and a higher prevalence farther north along the flyways. We discuss the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza A virus in wild birds in relation to host ecology and compare our results with published studies. These data are useful for designing new surveillance programs and are particularly relevant due to increased interest in avian influenza in wild birds.

AB In this study we present a bacteriophage isolated from the Great Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge (GSP) that is shown to have a genome size of 340 kb, unusually large for a bacterial virus. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the virion showed this to be a Myoviridae, the first reported to infect the genus Halomonas. This temperate phage, Phi gspC, exhibits a broad host range, displaying the ability to infect two different Halomonas spp. also isolated from the GSP. The phage infection process demonstrates a high level of tolerance towards temperature, pH and salinity; however, free virions are rapidly inactivated in water unless supplemented with salt. We show that susceptibility to osmotic shock is correlated with the density of the packaged DNA (rho(pack)). Lysogens of Halomonas salina GSP21 were detrimental to host fitness at 10% salinity, but the lysogen was able to grow faster than the wild type at 20% salinity. From these results we propose that the extensive genome of Phi gspC may encode environmentally relevant genes (ERGs); genes that are perhaps not essential for the phage life cycle but increase host and phage fitness in some environmental conditions.

AB The genetic diversity of many DNA Virus Populations in nature is unknown, but for those that have been studied it has been found to be relatively high. This is particularly true for baculoviruses, a family of large double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the larval stages of insects. Why there should be Such heterogeneity within these Virus Populations is puzzling and what Sustains it is still unknown. It has long been recognized that some baculoviruses have a relatively wide host range, but the effect of different host species on the genotypic structure of a baculovirus population has received little attention. We provide evidence that infection of different insect species can influence the genetic diversity of a Panolis flammea nucleopolyhedrovirus (PaflNPV) Population, isolated from the pine beauty moth. Variable regions of the PaflNPV genome were sequenced and novel ORF's were identified on each of the enlarged fragments. The roles of these orfs and the implications of their presence or absence within different genotypes are discussed. The variable fragments were also labelled with P-32 and used as polymorphic genetic markers of genotype abundance. The proportion of polymorphic loci changed after passage in different insect species and this varied among species, suggesting a role for host selection of pathogen genotypes in the field as a mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity. These results have wide-ranging implications for understanding the ecology of insect-virus interactions in the natural environment and the evolution of baculovirus life history strategies.

AB Genotypic and phenotypic variation of SeMNPV was examined in seven isolates of SeMNPV originating from occlusion body (OB) populations in the soil of greenhouses in Spain. Semi-quantitative PCR indicated that some of the isolates were composed of a single dominant genotype, whereas other isolates were composed of two or three genotypes in equal proportions. The coexistence of genotypes could be explained by trade-offs among the three phenotypic traits analyzed, namely pathogenicity (LD50), speed of kill (mean time to death), and OB yields, so that increases in one trait were accompanied by decreases in another. Mixed genotype isolates tended to behave differently to single genotype isolates. Two of the genotypic mixtures were significantly more pathogenic (lower LD50 values) for Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) larvae than the single genotypes that they comprised. OB yield/insect was greater for single genotype compared to mixed genotype isolates, despite genotype-specific differences in mean times to death. Total OB production/insect was positively correlated with time to death. Two out of three of the mixed genotype isolates had lower OB yield/mg insect weight at death compared to single genotype isolates. Each genotypic combination appeared to interact to produce a unique phenotype. This suggests the existence of trade-offs between traits leading to the coexistence of distinct genotypes and genotypic mixtures with similar transmissibility. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB While it is well established that viruses play an important role in the structure of marine microbial food webs, few studies have directly addressed their role in large lake systems. As part of an ongoing study of the microbial ecology of Lake Erie, we have examined the distribution and diversity of viruses in this system. One surprising result has been the pervasive distribution of cyanophages that infect the marine cyanobacterial isolate Synechococcus sp. strain WH7803. Viruses that lytically infect this cyanobacterium were identified throughout the western basin of Lake Erie, as well as in locations within the central and eastern basins. Analyses of the gene encoding the g20 viral capsid assembly protein (a conservative phylogenetic marker for the cyanophage) indicate that these viruses, as well as amplicons from natural populations and the ballast of commercial ships, are related to marine cyanophages but in some cases form a unique clade, leaving questions concerning the native hosts of these viruses. The results suggest that cyanophages may be as important in freshwater systems as they are known to be in marine systems.

AB Dinoflagellates (Dinophyccac) are considered to be one of the most abundant and diverse groups of phytoplankton; however, the viral impact on dinoflagellates was not studied untill recently. This review shows the present information concerning the viruses infecting dinoflagellates and the ecology relationships between the host and the virus. So far, two viruses have been isolated and characterized: a large DNA virus (HcV: Heterocapsa circularisquama virus) and a small RNA virus (HcRNAV: H. circularisquama RNA virus); both of which are infectious to the harmful bloom-forming dinoflagellate H. circularisquama.
   In the present we mainly discuss the relationship between HcRNAV and H. circularlsquama From the viewpoint of physiology ecology and genetics. It will help clarify the viral impact on dinoflagellate populations in marine environments to understand the host/parasite ecology.

AB Microbial ecology examines the diversity and activity of micro-organisms in Earth's biosphere. In the last 20 years, the application of genomics tools have revolutionized microbial ecological studies and drastically expanded our view on the previously underappreciated microbial world. This review first introduces the basic concepts in microbial ecology and the main genomics methods that have been used to examine natural microbial populations and communities. In the ensuing three specific sections, the applications of the genomics in microbial ecological research are highlighted. The first describes the widespread application of multilocus sequence typing and representational difference analysis in studying genetic variation within microbial species. Such investigations have identified that migration, horizontal gene transfer and recombination are common in natural microbial populations and that microbial strains can be highly variable in genome size and gene content. The second section highlights and summarizes the use of four specific genomics methods (phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA, DNA-DNA re-association kinetics, metagenomics, and micro-arrays) in analysing the diversity and potential activity of microbial populations and communities from a variety of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Such analyses have identified many unexpected phylogenetic lineages in viruses, bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes. Functional analyses of environmental DNA also revealed highly prevalent, but previously unknown, metabolic processes in natural microbial communities. In the third section, the ecological implications of sequenced microbial genomes are briefly discussed. Comparative analyses of prokaryotic genomic sequences suggest the importance of ecology in determining microbial genome size and gene content. The significant variability in genome size and gene content among strains and species of prokaryotes indicate the highly fluid nature of prokaryotic genomes, a result consistent with those from multilocus sequence typing and representational difference analyses. The integration of various levels of ecological analyses coupled to the application and further development of high throughput technologies are accelerating the pace of discovery in microbial ecology.

AB The huge amount of genomic data now becoming available offers both opportunities and challenges for epidemiologists. In this "preview" of likely developments as the field of ecological genomics evolves and merges with epidemiology, we discuss how epidemiology can use new information about genetic sequences and gene expression to form predictions about epidemic features and outcomes and for understanding host resistance and pathogen evolution. DNA sequencing is now complete for some hosts and several pathogens. Microarrays make it possible to measure gene expression simultaneously for thousands of genes. These tools will contribute to plant disease epidemiology by providing information about which resistance or pathogenicity genes are present in individuals and populations, what genes other than those directly involved in resistance and virulence are important in epidemics, the role of the phenotypic status of hosts and pathogens, and the role of the status of the environmental metagenome. Conversely, models of group dynamics supplied by population biology and ecology may be used to interpret gene expression within individual organisms and in populations of organisms. Genomic tools have great potential for improving understanding of resistance gene evolution and the durability of resistance. For example, DNA sequence analysis can be used to evaluate whether an arms race model of co-evolution is supported. Finally, new genomic tools will make it possible to consider the landscape ecology of epidemics in terms of host resistance both as determined by genotype and as expressed in host phenotypes in response to the biotic and abiotic environment. Host phenotype mixtures can be modeled and evaluated, with epidemiological predictions based on phenotypic characteristics such as physiological age and status in terms of induced systemic resistance or systemic acquired resistance.

AB Mono Lake is a meromictic, hypersaline, soda lake that harbors a diverse and abundant microbial community. A previous report documented the high viral abundance in Mono Lake, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of viral DNA from lake water samples showed a diverse population based on a broad range of viral genome sizes. To better understand the ecology of bacteriophages and their hosts in this unique environment, water samples were collected between February 2001 and July 2004 for isolation of bacteriophages by using four indigenous bacterial hosts. Plaque assay results showed a differential seasonal expression of cultured bacteriophages. To reveal the diversity of uncultured bacteriophages, viral DNA from lake water samples was used to construct clone libraries. Sequence analysis of viral clones revealed homology to viral as well as bacterial proteins. Furthermore, dot blot DNA hybridization analyses showed that the uncultured viruses are more prevalent during most seasons, whereas the viral isolates (A phi and phi 2) were less prevalent, confirming the belief that uncultured viruses represent the dominant members of the community, whereas cultured isolates represent the minority species.

AB In order to determine the actual prevalence of avian influenza viruses (AIV) in wild birds in Germany, extensive surveillance studies were carried out between March 2003 and January 2005. More than 3.000 samples of 79 different species of wild birds (migratory and resident birds) were taken and 1.151 established pools investigated. Samples came from 80 different regions of Germany. Forty AIV isolates representing 14 combinations of eight different hemagglutinin and eight neuraminidase subtypes, among them H5 and H7, were identified. All H5 and H7 isolates were found to be of low pathogenicity.
   The overall incidence of the investigated pools based on virus isolation was 3,5%, for AIV, with considerable variability noted among species, season and location. All AIV were isolated from birds sampled in autumn. Most of the AIV isolates came from the resting or wintering areas of mallards breeding far north. This study adds to the understanding of the ecology of influenza viruses in wild birds and empahsizes the constant need for surveillance in times of an ongoing and expanding epidemic of highly pathogenic Al.

AB We isolated a cyanophage (Ma-LMM01) that specifically infects a toxic strain of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the virion is composed of an isometric head and a tail complex consisting of a central tube and a contractile sheath with helical symmetry. The morphological features and the host specificity suggest that Ma-LMM01 is a member of the cyanomyovirus group. Using semi-one-step growth experiments, the latent period and burst size were estimated to be 6 to 12 h and 50 to 120 infectious units per cell, respectively. The size of the phage genome was estimated to be ca. 160 kbp using pulse-field gel electrophoresis; the nucleic acid was sensitive to DNase I, Bal31, and all 14 restriction enzymes tested, suggesting that it is a linear double-stranded DNA having a low level of methylation. Phylogenetic analyses based on the deduced amino acid sequences of two open reading frames coding for ribonucleotide reductase alpha- and beta-subunits showed that Ma-LMM01 forms a sister group with marine and freshwater cyanobacteria and is apparently distinct from T4-like phages. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the putative sheath protein showed that Ma-LMM01 does not form a monophyletic group with either the T4-like phages or prophages, suggesting that Ma-LMM01 is distinct from other T4-like phages that have been described despite morphological similarity. The host-phage system which we studied is expected to contribute to our understanding of the ecology of Microcystis blooms and the genetics of cyanophages, and our results suggest the phages could be used to control toxic cyanobacterial blooms.

AB Avian influenza A viruses (AIV) are the causative agents of the presently most important poultry disease. Ten countries in Asia and several other countries in Eastern Europe suffer high losses from the lethal effects of these viruses of the H5N1 subtype. AIV of other subtypes cause in additional countries severe losses. The threat to health and well-being of the avifauna, domestic poultry and possibly mammals including humans are worldwide of major concern. The European Union reacted with a complete import ban on untreated meat, eggs, poultry products as well as free-living and pet birds. Extensive surveillance of free-living birds and domestic poultry that is maintained in free-range and close to open waters were initiated in an attempt to gather information on the current status of infection with these viruses and to target appropriate countermeasures for the protection of domestic poultry (in-house keeping) and to safeguard food production for humans. Since the monitoring of free-living birds is labour-intensive, costly, and time-consuming, only birds should be included in the monitoring programme that harboured in the past most if not all influenza A viruses. The birds of the order Anatiformes, family Anatidae, subfamilies Ansennae and Anatinae, provided 65.9% of all avian AIV isolates. The cosmopolitan Common Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the dominant species with the highest rate of isolations among all bird species. Second in frequency is the North-American Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors). Consequently, free-living anatiform birds of the genera Anas and Spatula should comprise the main focus for the collection of cloacal and pharyngeal swabs. With the likely exception of the most recent H5N1 viruses, signs of disease were not recorded in AIV infected anatiform birds. AIV isolations were definitely less frequently obtained from birds of the orders Phasianiformes (including domestic chickens and turkeys), Charadriformes (plovers and lapwings), Lariformes (gulls), Columbiformes (pigeons) and Psittaciformes (psittacines) and need less attention in sampling efforts. This review presents also data on taxonomy and most suitable means for isolation and typing of haemagglutinating viruses. The different frequencies of the detection of 16 haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 9 subtypes of neuraminidase (NA) surface antigens are composed on the basis of extensive literature retrievals. Both antigens occure in isolates at different frequencies. Only 103 of all 144 possible HA x NA combinations were described so far. The AIV that contain the HA subtypes H3, H4, H6 are most frequently isolated whereas the AIV of the subtypes H5 and H7 were less frequently encountered. All other HAs are rather rare. AIV that possess the NA of the subtypes N2, N1, N8 and N3 are frequent and all other NAs are rarely detected.

AB A novel virus (Chaetoceros nuclear inclusion virus: CspNIV) causing lysis of a culture of the diatom Chaetoceros cf. gracilis was isolated from the Chesapeake Bay, USA, in April 2003. Transmission electron microscopy Of ultrathin sections of infected C. cf. gracilis revealed that CspNIV proliferates within the nucleus and forms paracrystalline arrays corresponding to the alignment of icosahedral viral particles of about 25 nm diameter. CspNIV shows some strong similarities with Heterosigma akashiwo nuclear inclusion virus (HaNIV) (cf. Lawrence et al. 2001; J Phycol 37: 216-222). The latent period of CspNIV is <24 h. The most widespread occurrence of Chaetoceros viruses in Chesapeake Bay was recorded in April 2003, ca. 1 mo after the winter-spring Chaetoceros bloom. However, results indicate that CspNIV remains infectious in surface water of the bay no longer than 1 mo after the disappearance of its host. Thus, our results reinforce the idea that microalgae are also sensitive to viruses other than those belonging to the family Phycodnaviridae. Furthermore, discovery and initial description of the infection process and ecology of CspNIV expands the breadth of phytoplankton shown to be susceptible to viral attack to include a ubiquitous diatom genera.

AB Presence in Cameroon of the recently introduced Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) in association with the indigenous Aedes aegypti (L.) raises public heath concerns because it might alter the risk of arbovirus transmission. The breeding site and distribution of the two Stegomyia species are updated and reported following entomological surveys carried out in 22 localities throughout Cameroon, with a total of 1,353 containers with water visited. Ae. aegypti was found in every location sampled, showing higher infestation rates in northern Cameroon. Breeding populations of Ae. albopictus were observed in all 19 southern localities, up to the Adamaoua mountains, but the species was not recorded further north. In the area where both species are present, they were often sampled in the same larval developmental sites, suggesting convergent habitat segregation. The most frequently encountered artificial and natural breeding sites were used tires, discarded tins and plastic containers, abandoned car parts, brick holes, dead leaves on the ground, tree holes, and rock pools. Further monitoring of the demographic as well as geographic expansion of Ae. albopictus in this Afrotropical environment and its relationships with indigenous Ae. aegypti should provide insight into the biology of this highly invasive species and help to implement arboviruses surveillance programs in the area.

AB Tailed bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities in marine environments. However, most of these marine phages are uncharacterized because few of their hosts have been cultivated. To learn more about such phages, we designed a set of degenerate PCR primers for phage T4 g23, which encodes the major capsid protein in all of the T4-type phages, an important family of the tailed phage. These primers were used to amplify g23-related sequences from diverse marine environments (fjords and bays of British Columbia, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the western Arctic Ocean) revealing a remarkable level of molecular diversity, which in some cases was correlated with morphological variation of the virions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that although some of these sequences were closely related to well studied subgroups of the T4-type phage, such as the T-evens, the majority of them belong to five previously uncharacterized subgroups. These data indicate that the host range of T4-type phages is much broader than previously imagined and that the laboratory isolate T4 belongs to a phage family that is extraordinarily widespread and diverse in the biosphere.

AB Thraustochytrids are cosmopolitan osmoheterotrophic microorganisms that play important roles as decomposers, producers of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and pathogens of mollusks, especially in coastal ecosystems. SssRNAV, a novel single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus infecting the marine fungoid protist Schizochytrium sp. (Labyrinthulea, Thraustochytriaceae) was isolated from the coastal water of Kobe Harbor, Japan, in July 2000, and its basic characteristics were examined. The virus particle is icosahedral, lacks a tail, and is ca. 25 nm in diameter. SssRNAV formed crystalline arrays and random assemblies within the cytoplasm of host cells, and it was also concentrated along the intracellular membrane structures. By means of one-step growth experiments, the lytic cycle and the burst size were estimated to be <8 h and 5.8 X 10(3) to 6.4 x 10(4) infectious units per host cell, respectively. SssRNAV had a single molecule of ssRNA that was approximately 10.2 kb long, three major proteins (37, 34, and 32 kDa), and two minor proteins (80 and 18 kDa). Although SssRNAV was considered to have some similarities with invertebrate viruses belonging to the family Dicistroviridae based on its partial nucleotide sequence, further genomic analysis is required to determine the detailed classification and nomenclature of SssRNAV. Our results indicate that viral infection is one of the significant factors controlling the dynamics of thraustochytrids and provide new insights into understanding the ecology of these organisms.

AB Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.), known as the ancestor of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), is the most important germplasm for rice improvement. The first male sterility gene was found in the wild rice, and introduced to the cultivated rice, which launched the fast development of the high-yielding hybrid rice. Other agronomically beneficial traits in the wild rice, such as rice tungro virus resistance, bacterial leaf blight (Xa21 gene) resistance and acid sulfate soil tolerance, have played important roles in rice breeding. China has the northernmost distribution area of wild rice possessing great genetic diversity. However, most of the populations of this species have disappeared in China over the last three decades, mainly caused by habitat loss, fragmentation and other human disturbances. Unfortunately, the decline of existing populations still continues. In the present study, we reviewed studies on genetic diversity and conservation of this wild rice in China, concentrating on population structure, pollen competition, pollen/gene flow from cultivated rice to wild rice, and ecological restoration in relation to in situ conservation. The relatively high genetic diversity of populations of O. rufipogon in China suggests that there is great value for conservation. Considerable gene flow from cultivated rice to wild rice may alter the genetic structure of natural populations of O. rufipogon and eventually lead to its genetic erosion. Pollen competition between wild and cultivated rice has caused a low rate of crop-to-wild gene flow, but it does not completely prevent gene flow from the crop. Effective isolation measures should be undertaken in the regions where in situ conservation of O. rufipogon is carried out. Reintroduction is an important alternative for the in situ conservation of wild rice species. As wild rice is an important genetic resource, both in situ and ex situ conservation strategies are needed.

AB It is Possible to reconstruct near-complete, and possibly complete, genomes of the dominant members of microbial communities from DNA that is extracted directly from the environment. Genome sequences from environmental samples capture the aggregate characteristics of the strain population from which they were derived. Comparison of the sequence data within and among natural populations can reveal the evolutionary processes that lead to genome diversification and speciation. Community genomic datasets can also enable subsequent gene expression and proteomic studies to determine how resources are invested and functions are distributed among community members. Ultimately, genomics can reveal how individual species and strains contribute to the net activity of the community.

AB Bacteriophages are the most abundant life forms in the biosphere. They play important roles in bacterial ecology, evolution, adaptation to new environments, and pathogenesis of human bacterial infections. Here, we report the complete genomic sequences, and predicted proteins of 27 bacteriophages of the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Comparative nucleotide and protein sequence analysis indicates that these phages are a remarkable source of untapped genetic diversity, encoding 2,170 predicted protein-encoding ORFs, of which 1,402 cannot be annotated for structure or function, and 522 are proteins with no similarity to other phage or bacterial sequences. Based on their genome size, organization of their gene map and comparative nucleotide and protein sequence analysis, the S. aureus phages can be organized into three groups. Comparison of their gene maps reveals extensive genome mosaicism, hinting to a large reservoir of unidentified S. aureus phage genes. Among the phages in the largest size class (178-214 kbp) that we characterized is phage Twort, the first discovered bacteriophage (responsible for the Twort-D'Herelle effect). These phage genomes offer an exciting opportunity to discern molecular mechanisms of phage evolution and diversity.

AB The genus Thermococcus, comprised Of sulfur-reducing hyperthermophillic archaea, belongs to the order Thermococcales in Euryarchaeota along with the closely related genus Pyrococcus. The members of Thermococcus are ubiquitously present in natural high-temperature environments, and are therefore considered to play a major role in the ecology and metabolic activity of microbial consortia within hot-water ecosystems. To obtain insight into this important genus, we have determined and annotated the complete 2,088,737-base genome of Thermococcus kodakaraensis strain KOD1, followed by a comparison with the three complete genomes of Pyrococcus spp. A total of 2306 coding DNA sequences (CDSs) have been identified, among which half (1165 CDSs) are annotatable, whereas the functons of 41% (936 CDSs) cannot be predicted from the primary structures. The genome contains seven genes for probable transposases and four virus-related regions. Several proteins within these genetic elements show high similarities to those in Pyrococcus spp., implying the natural Occurrence of horizontal gene transfer Of such mobile elements among the order Thermococcales. Comparative genomics clarified that 1204 proteins, including those for information processing and basic metabolisms, are shared among T. kodakaraensis and the three Pyrococcus spp. On the other hand, among the set of 689 proteins unique to T. kodakaraensis, there are several intriguing proteins that might be responsible for the specific trait of the genus Thermococcus, Such as proteins involved in additional pyruvate oxidation, nucleotide metabolisms, unique or additional metal ion transporters, improved stress response system, and a distinct restriction system.

AB Understanding epidemiology and evolution of plant viruses requires knowledge of their ecology: obtaining information about the dynamics and genetic structure of viral populations in their various hosts is necessary to analyze host specialization and to identify reservoirs and inoculum sources. We present here a 3-year analysis of the population dynamics of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in Central Spain in weed hosts and melon. CMV infection in weed hosts was detected throughout the year and showed a clear seasonality, with maximum incidence of 20 to 30% in summer and autumn. The dynamics of CMV incidence were different in various weed habitats (i.e., fallow fields, edges, and wastelands), which differed in stability due to the degree of human intervention. CMV incidence in weed habitats was correlated with the amount of vegetation, estimated both as biomass and as soil cover by plants. CMV population dynamics in melon crops was unrelated to that in weed habitats. Genetic characterization by ribonuclease protection assays and biological characterization on differential hosts showed no significant differences in the frequency of genotypes or biotypes for CMV isolates from weeds or melon. Hence, different population dynamics in various hosts and habitats has not resulted in population differentiation, suggesting that migration between hosts and habitats prevents fragmentation of the population.

AB Wild aquatic birds are the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses, but little is known about the viruses' gene pool in wild birds. Therefore, we investigated the ecology and emergence of influenza viruses by conducting phylogenetic analysis of 70 matrix (M) genes of influenza viruses isolated from shorebirds and gulls in the Delaware Bay region and from ducks in Alberta, Canada, during > 18 years of surveillance. In our analysis, we included 61 published M genes of isolates from various hosts. We showed that M genes of Canadian duck viruses and those of shorebird and gull viruses in the Delaware Bay shared ancestors with the M genes of North American poultry viruses. We found that North American and Eurasian avian-like lineages are divided into sublineages, indicating that multiple branches of virus evolution may be maintained in wild aquatic birds. The presence of non-H13 gull viruses in the gull-like lineage and of H13 gull viruses in other avian lineages suggested that gulls' M genes do not preferentially associate with the H13 subtype or segregate into a distinct lineage. Some North American avian influenza viruses contained M genes closely related to those of Eurasian avian viruses. Therefore, there may be interregional mixing of the two clades. Reassortment of shorebird M and RA genes was evident, but there was no correlation among the RA or NA subtype, M gene sequence, and isolation time. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that influenza viruses in wild waterfowl contain distinguishable lineages of M genes.

AB Phages carrying the stx(2) gene were detected in a range of sewage samples using a plaque hybridization-based method. After detection, phages were isolated and propagated with a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli as host for characterization purposes. Although it was not possible to conduct propagation or transduction experiments on most of the phages, 11 reached a sufficiently high titre for studies of host infectivity, electron microscopy and sequencing of the stx(2) flanking regions to be performed. These phages showed a wide range of host infectivity and morphology. The genetic structure of the 5' stx flanking region appeared conserved whereas the 3' region differed from that of previously described phages. This is the first description of infectious stx-phages isolated as free particles in the environment, and as such constitutes a new contribution to the study of the ecology of these phages.

AB The finding that total viral abundance is higher than total prokaryotic abundance and that a significant fraction of the prokaryotic community is infected with phages in aquatic systems has stimulated research on the ecology of prokaryotic viruses and their role in ecosystems. This review treats the ecology of prokaryotic viruses (phages') in marine, freshwater and soil systems from a,virus point of view'. The abundance of viruses varies strongly in different environments and is related to bacterial abundance or activity suggesting that the majority of the viruses found in the environment are typically phages. Data on phage diversity are sparse but indicate that phages are extremely diverse in natural systems. Lytic phages are predators of prokaryotes, whereas lysogenic and chronic infections represent a parasitic interaction. Some forms of lysogeny might be described best as mutualism. The little existing ecological data on phage populations indicate a large variety of environmental niches and survival strategies. The host cell is the main resource for phages and the resource quality, i.e., the metabolic state of the host cell, is a critical factor in all steps of the phage life cycle. Virus-induced mortality of prokaryotes varies strongly on a temporal and spatial scale and shows that phages can be important predators of bacterioplankton. This mortality and the release of cell lysis products into the environment can strongly influence microbial food web processes and biogeochemical cycles. Phages can also affect host diversity, e.g., by 'killing the winner' and keeping in check competitively dominant species or populations. Moreover, they mediate gene transfer between prokaryotes, but this remains largely unknown in the environment. Genomics or proteomics are providing us now with powerful tools in phage ecology, but final testing will have to be performed in the environment.

AB Phytoplankton population dynamics are the result of imbalances between reproduction and losses. Losses include grazing, sinking, and natural mortality. As the importance of microbes in aquatic ecology has been recognized, so has the potential significance of viruses as mortality agents for phytoplankton. The field of algal virus ecology is steadily changing and advancing as new viruses are isolated and new methods are developed for quantifying the impact of viruses on phytoplankton dynamics and diversity. With this development, evidence is accumulating that viruses can control phytoplankton dynamics through reduction of host populations, or by preventing algal host populations from reaching high levels. The identification of highly specific host ranges of viruses is changing our understanding of population dynamics. Viral-mediated mortality may not only affect algal species succession, but may also affect intraspecies succession. Through cellular lysis, viruses indirectly affect the fluxes of energy, nutrients, and organic matter, especially during algal bloom events when biomass is high. Although the importance of viruses is presently recognized, it is apparent that many aspects of viral-mediated mortality of phytoplankton are still poorly understood. It is imperative that future research addresses the mechanisms that regulate virus infectivity, host resistance, genotype richness, abundance, and the fate of viruses over time and space.

AB Uncultured microorganisms comprise the majority of the planet's biological diversity. Microorganisms represent two of the three domains of life and contain vast diversity that is the product of an estimated 3.8 billion years of evolution. In many environments, as many as 99% of the microorganisms cannot be cultured by standard techniques, and the uncultured fraction includes diverse organisms that are only distantly related to the cultured ones. Therefore, culture-independent methods are essential to understand the genetic diversity, population structure, and ecological roles of the majority of microorganisms. Metagenomics, or the culture-independent genomic analysis of an assemblage of microorganisms, has potential to answer fundamental questions in microbial ecology. This review describes progress toward understanding the biology of uncultured Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses through metagenomic analyses.

AB Prochlorococcus is the numerically dominant phototroph in the tropical and subtropical oceans, accounting for half of the photosynthetic biomass in some areas(1,2). Here we report the isolation of cyanophages that infect Prochlorococcus, and show that although some are host-strain-specific, others cross-infect with closely related marine Synechococcus as well as between high-light-and low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus isolates, suggesting a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer. Highlight-adapted Prochlorococcus hosts yielded Podoviridae exclusively, which were extremely host-specific, whereas low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus and all strains of Synechococcus yielded primarily Myoviridae, which has a broad host range. Finally, both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus strain-specific cyanophage titres were low (< 10(3) ml(-1)) in stratified oligotrophic waters even where total cyanobacterial abundances were high (> 10(5) cells ml(-1)). These low titres in areas of high total host cell abundance seem to be a feature of open ocean ecosystems. We hypothesize that gradients in cyanobacterial population diversity, growth rates, and/or the incidence of lysogeny underlie these trends.

AB Phage infections represent a serious problem in the dairy industry where Streptococcus thermophilus is largely used as a starter in yogurt and cheese manufactures. The goal of the present study was to determine the permanence in the plant and the diversity among I I lytic S. thermophilus phages isolated from batches with acidifying problems in an Argentinian yogurt factory between 1998 and 2000. Phages were characterized by their morphology, restriction patterns, DNA-DNA hybridization analysis and host range. Restriction analysis of their genomes allow us to arrange them in six groups, while host spectrum using 20 S. thermophilus strains revealed five groups. A strong relationship among phages was observed when Southern and Dot blot hybridizations were performed. Sensitive strains were not lysogenic since neither of them was induced by mitomycin C. Our results, concerning the diversity, monitoring and permanence of phages in the dairy plant environment, complement the findings of authors that cover phage collections from European countries.

AB Phage T4 has provided countless contributions to the paradigms of genetics and biochemistry. Its complete genome sequence of 168,903 bp encodes about 300 gene products. T4 biology and its genomic sequence provide the best-understood model for modem functional genomics and proteomics. Variations on gene expression, including overlapping genes, internal translation initiation, spliced genes, translational bypassing, and RNA processing, alert us to the caveats of purely computational methods. The T4 transcriptional pattern reflects its dependence on the host RNA polymerase and the use of phage-encoded proteins that sequentially modify RNA polymerase; transcriptional activator proteins, a phage sigma factor, anti-sigma, and sigma decoy proteins also act to specify early, middle, and late promoter recognition. Posttranscriptional controls by T4 provide excellent systems for the study of RNA-dependent processes, particularly at the structural level. The redundancy of DNA replication and recombination systems of T4 reveals how phage and other genomes are stably replicated and repaired in different environments, providing insight into genome evolution and adaptations to new hosts and growth environments. Moreover, genomic sequence analysis has provided new insights into tail fiber variation, lysis, gene duplications, and membrane localization of proteins, while high-resolution structural determination of the "cell-puncturing device," combined with the three-dimensional image reconstruction of the baseplate, has revealed the mechanism of penetration during infection. Despite these advances, nearly 130 potential T4 genes remain uncharacterized. Current phage-sequencing initiatives are now revealing the similarities and differences among members of the T4 family, including those that infect bacteria other than Escherichia coli. T4 functional genomics will aid in the interpretation of these newly sequenced T4-related genomes and in broadening our understanding of the complex evolution and ecology of phages-the most abundant and among the most ancient biological entities on Earth.

AB Somatic coliphages detected by Escherichia coli strain WG5 have been proposed as potential indicators of water quality. Their potential replication in the water environment is considered a drawback for their use as indicators. However, the contribution of replication outside the gut to the total numbers has never been quantified. It has not been determined either the fraction of bacterial strains that might support replication of phages detected by strain WG5 in the water environment. We examined the sensitivity of 291 host strains to 25 phages by streaking slants of the presumptive host strain onto an agar layer that contains bacteriophages, which gives a total of 7275 combinations (sensitivity tests). Only a 3.02% of the tests showed sensitivity. Additionally, six environmental strains were used as hosts to count phages in sewage and seawater. Phages isolated on these strains were used to infect strain WG5. The environmental strains detected 1 log(10) fewer phages than strain WG5 in sewage and seawater. The fraction of phages that were detected by the six strains and that also infected strain WG5 ranged from < 0.07% to < 2.0% of the total amount of bacteriophages detected by strain WG5 in the same samples. Our results confirm that less than 3% of naturally occurring hosts support replication of phages infecting E. coli. We conclude that the contribution of replication to the number of somatic coliphages detected in the aquatic environment is negligible.

AB Pandemic influenza is a zoonosis. Studies on influenza ecology conducted in Hong Kong since the 1970s in which Hong Kong essentially functioned as an influenza sentinel post indicated that it might be possible, for the first time, to have influenza preparedness at the baseline avian level. This appreciation of influenza ecology facilitated recognition of the H5N1 'bird flu' incident in Hong Kong in 1997 in what was considered to be an incipient pandemic situation, the chicken being the source of virus for humans and, if so, was the first instance where a pandemic may have been averted. The 2001 and 2002 H5N1 incidents demonstrated that it was possible to have an even higher order of baseline preparedness with the recognition in chicken of a range of genotypes of H5N1-like viruses before they had the opportunity to infect humans.
   Investigations of these incidents revealed a complex ecology involving variously precursor avian H5N1 virus in geese and ducks, and H9N2 and H6N1 viruses in quail, the quail possibly functioning as an avian 'mixing vessel' for key genetic reassortment events for onward transmission of H5N1 viruses highly pathogenic for chicken and humans. These findings highlight the importance of systematic virus surveillance of domestic poultry in recognizing changes in virus occurrence, host range and pathogenicity as signals at the avian level that could presage a pandemic. For example, there is now an increasing prevalence of avian influenza viruses in terrestrial (in contrast to aquatic) poultry. Prior to 1997, no particular virus subtype other than H4N6 would have been considered a candidate for pandemicity and this was based, in the absence of any other data, on its high frequency of occurrence in ducks in southern China. Now, with the isolation of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses from humans supported by genetic, molecular and biological studies on these and other avian isolates, there is credible evidence for the candidacy, in order, of H5N1, H9N2 and H6N1 viruses. These viruses have been made available for the production of diagnostic reagents and exploratory vaccines.
   The 1997 incident upheld the hypothesis that southern China is an epicentre for the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses. However, the intensification of the poultry (chicken) industry worldwide coupled with the spread of viruses such as the Eurasian lineage of H9N2 suggest that the genesis of a pandemic could take place elsewhere in the world. This re-emphasizes the importance of systematic virus surveillance of poultry globally for international public health and for economic and food concerns.
   Faced with an incipient pandemic in 1997, Hong Kong brought in international experts to join the investigative effort. Good teamwork at all levels is essential in dealing with the many facets. The threat of a pandemic should not be minimized, nor should governments be lulled into a sense of false security. The media is a powerful channel and has the responsibility and the avenues to convey and influence public perception of events. Close liaison between the media and those on the operational side ensures effective, accurate and timely dissemination of information. This will enhance public confidence in the investigative process and in steps taken for its safety and health.

AB All microalgal host-virus systems isolated to date are lytic: the viruses lyse the infected hosts within hours after infection. Moreover, current models of phytoplankton host-virus interactions predict rapid extinction of both host and virus. Nevertheless, marine phytoplankton and their respective viruses do coexist in marine ecosystems. To investigate this apparent paradox we performed a series of experiments which show that phytoplankton populations always recover after virus-induced lysis and that endemic viral infections may promote survival of the host population. We hypothesize that phenotypic plasticity of algal susceptibility to viral infection makes such coexistence of host and virus possible.

AB Through their many sorption sites, microbial biofilms can accumulate both organic and inorganic particulate and colloidal material from bulk water environments. An application of such first principles to the ecology of "biocolloidal" enteric virions would suggest that they too may be concentrated by biofilms in a similar way. Though previous studies have isolated human gastrointestinal (enteric) virions from microbial biofilms, the exact human health significance of this has been neither fully investigated nor completely understood. Through an assessment of the location, accumulation and persistence of model enteric virions (phiX174, MS2 and B40-8 bacteriophages as well as 20 nm fluorescent latex microspheres) within biofilms, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether the interaction of enteric virions with distribution pipe biofilms could provide a secondary source of public health concern to consumers. Model enteric virions were found to be incorporated into biofilms at concentrations representing 1% of those present in the adjacent bulk water environment. A sub-population (0.01%) of these persisted throughout an experimental period of 30 days, inferring their potential to accumulate over time. Furthermore, model enteric virions were partitioned into bacterial microcolonies, environments where biofilm bacteria can persist and re-grow, even in the presence of "acceptable" levels of disinfection. A risk model for enteric virion accumulation and release from distribution pipe biofilms suggested that associated risks may exceed USEPA benchmark values. These findings could have wide-reaching implications in water treatment and distribution strategies, and necessitate a re-appraisal of current water guideline values.

AB Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains have been related with waterborne outbreaks. Besides O157:H7, several serotypes of E coli and other enterobacteria have been implicated in outbreaks and reported to carry the shiga toxin genes. Shiga toxins, stx1 and stx2, are important virulence factors of these strains. These genes have been linked to bacteriophages and consequently are susceptible to lateral transmission. To better understand the ecology of these genes a study of the presence of the shiga toxin 2 gene (stx2) among coliform bacteria present in sewage samples was carried out. A procedure based on colony hybridisation was developed for the isolation of enterobacteria carrying this gene. Colony growth on Chromocult(R) agar was transferred to a membrane and hybridised with a gene specific probe. The procedure allowed detection of about one colony carrying the gene among around 1,000 faecal coliform colonies. The numbers of bacteria carrying the gene in sewage were also estimated by PCR indicating that the numbers of bacteria carrying the stx2 gene were about 1/1,000 faecal coliforms. The detected numbers by both methods were similar. Positive colony hybridisation was detected in four sewage origins. Fifty-two colonies showing positive signal were isolated from the Chromocult(R) agar plates, confirmed to be stx2 positive by PCR and phenotypically characterised. Results of the characterisation showed certain diversity among the isolates even in isolates from the same sample. Most of these isolates would not have been isolated with the methods regularly used for the isolation of E coli O157:H7 strains. The method will allow study of the numbers and characteristics of bacteria carrying the stx2 gene in different water environments and isolate them in order to determine their role in the spread of the gene.

AB Influenza A viruses have been isolated from humans, from several other mammalian species and a wide variety of avian species, among which, wild aquatic birds represent the natural hosts of influenza viruses. The majority of the possible combinations of the 15 haemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) subtypes recognized have been identified in isolates from domestic and wild birds. Infection of birds can cause a wide range of clinical signs, which may vary according to the host, the virus strain, the host's immune status, the presence of any secondary exacerbating microorganisms and environmental factors. Most infections are inapparent, especially in water-fowl and other wild birds. In contrast, infections caused by viruses of H5 and H7 subtypes can be responsible for devastating epidemics in poultry. Despite the warnings to the poultry industry about these viruses, in 1997 an avian H5N1 influenza virus was directly transmitted from birds to humans in Hong Kong and resulted in 18 confirmed infections, thus strengthening the pandemic threat posed by avian influenza (AI). Indeed, reassortant viruses, harbouring a combination of avian and human viral genomes, have been responsible for major pandemics of human influenza. These considerations warrant the need to continue and broaden efforts in the surveillance of AI. Control programmes have varied from no intervention, as in the case of the occurrence of low pathogenic (LP) AI (LPAI) viruses, to extreme, expensive total quarantine-slaughter programmes carried out to eradicate highly pathogenic (HP) AI (HPAI) viruses. The adoption of a vaccination policy, targeted either to control or to prevent infection in poultry, is generally banned or discouraged. Nevertheless, the need to boost eradication efforts in order to limit further spread of infection and avoid heavy economic losses, and advances in modern vaccine technologies, have prompted a re-evaluation of the potential use of vaccination in poultry as an additional tool in comprehensive disease control strategies. This review presents a synthesis of the most recent research on AI that has contributed to a better understanding of the ecology of the virus and to the development of safe and efficacious vaccines for poultry.

AB The isolation and characterization of a virus (designated EhV) that infects the marine coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) Hay & Mohler are described. Three independent clones of EhV were isolated from Norwegian coastal waters in years 1999 and 2000. EhV is a double-stranded DNA-containing virus with a genome size of similar to415 kilo-base pairs. The viral particle is an icosahedron with a diameter of 160-180 nm. The virus particle contains at least nine proteins ranging from 10 to 140 kDa; the major capsid protein weighs similar to54 kDa. EhV has a latent period of 12-14 h and a burst size of 400-1000 (mean, 620) viral particles per cell. A phylogenetic tree based on DNA polymerase amino acid sequences indicates EhV should be assigned to the Phycodnaviridae virus family and that the virus is most closely related to viruses that infect Micromonas pusilla and certain Chlorella species.

AB A survey of poliovirus in river and sewage water was conducted from October 1993 to September 1995 in Toyama Prefecture, Japan. In this study, 25 isolates differentiated as type 2 vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) were characterized using mutant analysis by PCR and restriction-enzyme cleavage (MAPREC) to estimate the ratio of 481-G revertants correlated to neurovirulence in a virus population. Of these isolates, 23 (92%) comprised between 44 and 96% 481-G revertants by MAPREC. The other two isolates had revertant percentages close to the 0.6% of the attenuated reference strain. It was presumed that these 23 isolates would be variant with potential neurovirulence by MAPREC analysis. Of the 23 isolates, three were isolated from river water. Moreover, our results by MAPREC showed that type 2 poliovirus was phenotypically more variable than type 1 (69%) or type 3 (55%), as determined in previous studies. The prevalence of virulent-type VDPVs in river and sewage water suggested that the oral poliovaccine itself had led to wide environmental pollution in nature. To terminate the cycle of virus transmission in nature, the ecology of VDPVs should be studied further. A hygiene programme, inactivated poliovirus vaccine immunization and well-maintained herd immunity may play key roles in reducing the potential risk of infection by virulent VDPVs.

AB A reliable method to eliminate tobacco rattle virus (TRV) from viruliferous Paratrichodorus allius populations was developed. This virus is vectored by P. allius in the Pacific Northwest and causes corky ringspot disease (CRS) of potato The viruliferous nematodes that were reared on 'Vernema' alfalfa or `770' scotch spearmint for at least 3 months did not transmit TRV to 'Samsun NN" tobacco, a suitable indicator plant, and did not cause CRS symptoms on 'Russet Norkotah' tubers. A new isolate of TRV was introduced into a nonviruliferous population of P. allius. First, tobacco plants were inoculated with a field population of P. allius that transmitted an isolate of TRV that caused severe symptoms on potato. The tobacco roots were then washed free from the soil and dipped in 0.525% sodium hypochlorite to remove the initial nematode inoculum. After the disinfected tobacco plants recovered and began to grow, the virus-free population of P, allius was introduced around the root system to acquire the new virus isolate from tobacco roots. The newly established combination caused CRS symptoms on 'Russet Norkotah' that were characteristic of the more virulent virus isolate, indicating that the virus-free P. allius population had reacquired virus.

AB In Italy, multiple H3N2 influenza viruses were isolated from chickens with mild respiratory disease and were shown to replicate in the respiratory tracts of experimentally infected chickens; this finding is the first to show that H3N2 influenza viruses can replicate and cause disease in chickens. H3N2 influenza viruses in pigs on nearby farms seemed a likely source of the virus; however, antigenic and molecular analyses revealed that the gene segments of the viruses in chickens were mainly of Eurasian avian origin and were distinguishable from those isolated from pigs and wild aquatic birds in Italy. Thus, several different H3 influenza viruses were circulating in Italy, but we failed to identify the source of the chicken H3N2 influenza viruses that have disappeared subsequently from Italian poultry. Until recently, the transmission of influenza viruses (other than the H5 and H7 subtypes) from their reservoir in aquatic birds to chickens was rarely detected and highly pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses were considered to be restricted to poultry species. However, the recent reports of the transmission of H9N2 and H5N1 influenza viruses to chickens in Hong Kong and, subsequently, to humans and our findings of the transmission of H3N2 influenza viruses to domestic chickens in Italy suggest an increased role for chickens as an intermediate host in the ecology of influenza.

AB Aims: The aim of this work was to isolate bacteriocins from the environment that would be effective in neutralizing Vibrio vulnificus in seafood.
   Methods and Results: Water samples from Wilmington (NC, USA) were plated to determine total viable counts and to isolate presumptive Vibrio spp. Isolates containing plasmids were checked for antimicrobial activity which was not due to lytic bacteriophage or small, non-specific molecules. Three bacteriocin producers were detected and their inhibitory spectra determined: IWI inhibited few strains of V. vulnificus; BC1 inhibited several strains of V vulnificus, V cholerae and V parahaemolyticus and BC2 inhibited all tested Vibrio spp., Plesiomonas shigelloides and Escherichia coli. Loss of inhibitory, activity coincided with loss of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid. The bacteriocins were found to be between 1.3 and 9.0 kDa. IWI was heat labile, while BC1 was moderately stable except at extreme temperatures. BC2 was very stable and maintained its activity when frozen, autoclaved or exposed to extreme pH values
   Conclusions: Bacteriocins have been isolated from environmental isolates of V. vulnificus and V. cholerae. BC2, with its broad spectrum and stability, may, be useful in neutralizing V. vulnificus.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The results have significance in relation to reducing the occurrence of food poisoning caused by V. vulnificus.

AB Genetic structure of Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of potato and tomato late blight, was analyzed spatially in a mixed potato and tomato production area in the Del Fuerte Valley, Sinaloa, Mexico. Isolates of P. infestans were characterized by mating type, allozyme analysis at the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and peptidase loci, restriction fragment length polymorphism with probe RG57, metalaxyl sensitivity, and aggressiveness to tomato and potato. Spatial patterns of P. infestans genotypes were analyzed by geographical information systems and geostatistics during the seasons of 1994-95, 1995-96, and 1996-97. Spatial analysis of the genetic structure of P. infestans indicates that geographic substructuring of this pathogen occurs in this area. Maps displaying the probabilities of occurrence of mating types and genotypes of P. infestans, and of disease severity at a regional scale, were presented. Some genotypes that exhibited differences in epidemiologically important features such as metalaxyl sensitivity and aggressiveness to tomato and potato had a restricted spread and were localized in isolated areas. Analysis of late blight severity showed recurring patterns, such as the earliest onset of the disease in the area where both potato and tomato were growing, strengthening the hypothesis that infected potato tubers are the main source of primary inoculum. The information that geostatistical analysis provides might help improve management programs for late blight in the Del Fuerte Valley.

AB Two Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae bacteriophages with contrasting properties were isolated from a field site in which the survival of genetically modified R. leguminosarum inoculants had been monitored for several years. Inoculant strain RSM2004 was used as the indicator for phage isolation and propagation. One phage, RL1RES, was temperate and could not replicate in any of the 42 indigenous R. leguminosarum field isolates tested although nested PCR indicated that phage sequences were present in six of the isolates. The second phage, RL2RES, was virulent, capable of generalised transduction, contained DNA with modified cytosine residues, and was capable of infecting all field isolates tested although the GM inoculant strain CT0370 was resistant. Sequence with homology to RL2RES was detected by nested PCR in six of the 42 field-isolates. These were not the same isolates that showed homology to RL1RES. The implication of these findings for the survival of rhizobial inoculants, and the ecology of phages and their host bacteria, are discussed.

AB We describe two prolonged bacteriophage blooms within sugar beet rhizospheres ensuing from an artificial increase in numbers of an indigenous soil bacterium, Further, we provide evidence of in situ competition between these phages, This is the first in situ demonstration of such microbial interactions in soil, To achieve this, sugar beet seeds were inoculated with Serratia liquefaciens CP6RS or its lysogen, CP6RS-ly-Phi 1. These were sown, along with uninoculated seeds, in 36 field plots arranged in a randomized Latin square. The plots were then sampled regularly over 194 days, and the plants were assayed for the released bacteria and any infectious phages, Both the lysogen and nonlysogen forms of CP6RS survived equally well in situ, contradicting earlier work suggesting lysogens have a competitive disadvantage in nature. A Podoviridae phage, identified as Phi CP6-4, flourished on the nonlysogen-inoculated plants in contrast to those plants inoculated with the lysogen, Conversely, the Siphoviridae phage Phi CP6-1 (used to construct the released lysogen) was isolated abundantly from the lysogen-treated plants but almost never on the nonlysogen-inoculated plants. The uninoculated plants also harbored some Phi CP6-1 phage up to day 137, yet hardly any Phi CP6-4 phages were found, and this was consistent with previous years. We sinew that the different temporal and spatial distributions of these two physiologically distinct phages can bt: explained by application of optimal foraging theory to phage ecology. This is the first time that such in situ evidence has been provided in support of this theoretical model.

AB Influenza is a highly contagious, acute illness which has afflicted humans and animals since ancient times. Influenza viruses are part of the Orthomyxoviridae family and are grouped into types A, B and C according to antigenic characteristics of the core proteins. Influenza A viruses infect a large variety of animal species, including humans, pigs, horses, sea mammals and birds, occasionally producing devastating pandemics in humans, such as in 1918, when over twenty million deaths occurred world-wide. The two surface glycoproteins of the virus, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are the most important antigens for inducing protective immunity in the host and therefore show the greatest variation. For influenza A viruses, fifteen antigenically distinct HA subtypes and nine NA subtypes are recognised at present; a virus possesses one HA and one NA subtype, apparently in any combination. Although viruses of relatively few subtype combinations have been isolated from mammalian species, all subtypes, in most combinations, have been isolated from birds. In the 20th Century, the sudden emergence of antigenically different strains in humans, termed antigenic shift, has occurred on four occasions, as follows, in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2) and 1977 (H1N1), each resulting in a pandemic. Frequent epidemics have occurred between the pandemics as a result of gradual antigenic change in the prevalent virus, termed antigenic drift. Currently, epidemics occur throughout the world in the human population due to infection with influenza A Viruses of subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 or with influenza B virus. The impact of these epidemics is most effectively measured by monitoring excess mortality due to pneumonia and influenza. Phylogenetic studies suggest that aquatic birds could be the source of all influenza A viruses in other species. Human pandemic strains are thought to have emerged through one of the following three mechanisms:
   genetic reassortment (occurring as a result of the segmented genome of the virus) of avian and human influenza A viruses infecting the same host
   direct transfer of whole virus from another species
   the re-emergence of a virus which may have caused an epidemic many years earlier.
   Since 1996, the viruses H7N7, H5N1 and H9N2 have been transmitted from birds to humans but have apparently failed to spread in the human population. Such incidents are rare, but transmission between humans and other animals has also been demonstrated. This has led to the suggestion that the proposed reassortment of human and avian viruses occurs in an intermediate animal with subsequent transference to the human population. Pigs have been considered the leading contender for the role of intermediary because these animals may serve as hosts for productive infections of both avian and human viruses and, in addition, the evidence strongly suggests that pigs have been involved in interspecies transmission of influenza viruses, particularly the spread of H1N1 viruses to humans. Global surveillance of influenza is maintained by a network of laboratories sponsored by the World Health Organization. The main control measure for influenza in human populations is immunoprophylaxis, aimed at the epidemics occurring between pandemics.

AB Sphingomonas species play an important role in the ecology of a range of marine habitats. Isolates and 16S-rRNA clones have been obtained from corals, natural and artificial sources of marine hydrocarbons and eutrophic and oligotrophic waters, and have been isolated as hosts for marine phages. In addition they are found in oceans spanning temperature ranges from polar to temperate waters. While less is known about marine sphingomonads in comparison to their terrestrial counterparts, their importance in microbial ecology is evident. This is illustrated by, for example, the numerical dominance of strain RB2256 in oligotrophic waters. Furthermore, the known marine sphingomonads represent a phylogenetic cross-section of the Sphingomonas genus. This review focuses on our present knowledge of cultured isolates and 16S-rDNA clones from marine environments.

AB Six phages (Phi CP6-1 to (Phi CP6-6) that are commonly found in the phytosphere of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris var. Amethyst) were investigated, and their relative impacts on their host (Serratia liquefaciens CP6) were compared. There were fundamental differences between the two most abundant predators of CP6 Phi CP6-1 and Phi CP6-4), Like Phi CP6-2 and Phi CP6-5, Phi CP6-1 belonged to the family Siphoviridae, while Phi CP6-4 exhibited the morphology of the family Podoviridae, The other phages were members of the family Myoviridae, DNA-DNA crosshybridization revealed that Phi CP6-1 and Phi CP6-4 had little common DNA, although all of the other phages exhibited some genetic similarity. Like Phi CP6-2, Phi CP6-3, and Phi CP6-5, Phi CP6-1 was capable of forming a lysogenic association with its host, while Phi CP6-4 and Phi CP6-6 appeared to be entirely virulent. Single-step growth curve experiments revealed that Phi CP6-4 had a much shorter latent period and a smaller burst size than Phi CPC-1. Also, Phi CP6-1 could transduce a number of host chromosomal markers with transfer frequencies of 2.9 x 10(-9) to 3.9 x 10(-7), whereas Phi CP6-4 could not transduce S. liquefaciens CP6 genes. When viewed in the context of the strikingly different temporal niches of these phages, our data provide an insight into how bacteriophage interactions with their hosts might reflect the natural ecology of bacteriophages, Our data also illustrate how the potential for gene transfer changes over time in an environment that supports several different phages.

AB It is well documented that bacteria can readily exchange genetic information under artificial conditions typically used in most laboratory studies as well as to some extent in nature. The three mechanisms by which such genetic exchange can occur are transformation, transduction and conjugation. Transformation is the uptake of free DNA into a cell from the surrounding environment, while bacterial viruses mediate the exchange of genetic material during transduction and conjugation involves the direct transfer of DNA during cell-to-cell contact. In most cases, plasmids mediate the transfer of DNA during conjugation events, although chromosomal transfer can also occur. This review will focus mainly on plasmids and the role of conjugation in marine sediment microbial communities. Plasmids, although often dispensible, provide a unique plasticity to an individual host cell or to an entire microbial community 'genome'. Specifically, plasmid-encoded traits mobilized throughout microbial communities can provide a means of rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Examples of such adaptation can be seen in the increased frequencies of catabolic plasmids and antibiotic and heavy metal resistance plasmids within microbial populations upon exposure to selective pressures. Presently, the view of plasmid diversity and horizontal transfer dynamics is predominantly based on broad- and narrow-host-range plasmids isolated from bacteria of clinical and animal origins. While the exchange of plasmids is most likely an important mechanism by which bacterial populations in clinical environments can evolve and adapt, there remains a general lack of information regarding the role of plasmid-mediated transfer in marine ecosystems and how indigenous plasmids impact the microbial community structure and function. The combined application of molecular biology and microbial ecology techniques is providing new approaches to address the ecological role of plasmids in marine environments.

AB Two bacteriophage collections were examined with regard to their ability to form plaques on multiple bacterial host species. Nine of 10 phages studied were found to be broad-host-range bacteriophages. These phages fell into two groups. Group 1, the SN series, was isolated from sewage treatment plant samples with Sphaerotilus natans ATCC 13338 as a host. The DNAs of these bacteriophages contained modified bases and were insensitive to cleavage by type I and II restriction endonucleases. The efficiency of plating of these bacteriophages was changed only slightly on the alternate host. Group 2, the BHR series, was isolated by a two-host enrichment protocol. These bacteriophages were sensitive to restriction, and their efficiency of plating was dramatically reduced on the alternate host. Our results suggest that a multiple-host enrichment protocol may be more effective for the isolation of broad-host-range bacteriophages by avoiding the selection bias inherent in single-host methods. At least two of the broad-host-range bacteriophages mediated generalized transduction. We suggest that broad-host-range bacteriophages play a key role in phage ecology and gene transfer in nature.

AB Even though the contribution of water ecosystems for disseminating enteric viral pathogens has been known for decades, the importance of wild virions iii structuring aquatic communities and food webs has only come to light relatively recently. Evidences of viral infections in both pro-and eukaryotic phytoplankton, as well as in heterotrophic bacterio-and protozooplankton, have recently brought marine biologists to question the impact of viroplankton on processes such as (1) the mortality of microorganisms, (2) the nutrition of heterotrophic protists, (3) the promotion of genetic material exchanges among microbial populations, (4) the maintenance of species diversity, (5) the induction of planktonic aggregates, and (6) the cycling of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, all these points are reviewed and discussed, in the light of recent contributions to the ecology of aquatic viruses, for evidence of the impact of viruses on both steady and non-steady state processes in fresh- and salt-waters.
   Viruses are ubiquitous, abundant and dynamic components of pelagic ecosystems. They are, undoubtedly, more diversified than the phage-like morphotypes that are generally characterized by the presence of an icosa- or octahedral head and a tail, via observations under electron microscope. The diversity of planktonic viruses is further enhanced from the genetic viewpoint, and likely implies the diversity of sensible hosts. Genetically related marine phages are likely widely distributed in the space (i. e. without significant geographical segregation), suggesting prevalence of a reduced competition among viral ''populations'', and that the main biotic limiting factor for a viral ''species'' production is the density of the sensible host. Some viral ''species'', known from marine systems, typically harbor knob-like projections and long spines (i. e. previously not noted from non.-aquatic habitats), which are suggested to increase the efficiency of hitting a specific host, especially in oligotrophic waters. Despite the general scarcity of viral isolates that lyse ciliated protozooplankton and metazoan zooplankton, it is becoming increasingly evident that most of the pelagic pro-and eukaryotic organisms are subject to infectious attacks from ambient ''free-living'' viruses.
   Quantitatively, recent total counts from the plankton generally fall in between 10(4) and 10(8) viruses ml(-1), with seasonal high densities in spring and summer, and a lowering tendency in abundance from the coastal to the open marine systems, and from the surface to the depth waters, likely in relation to temperature and the organic matter load. it was recently shown that lytic infection, rather than induction of lysogeny, is responsible for the majority of bacteriophage production in the plankton, especially in the coastal marine and surface waters and during blooming events, where the threshold-product level of virus x bacteria numbers of greater than or equal to 10(12) for the start of a viral-lytic activity is generally achieved. Closed linear relationships have been reported between viroplankton dynamics and bacteria, algae and nutrients. Because of the preponderance of allochtonous organic matter and cyanobacterial cells in lakes as compared to oceanic systems, the virus-to-bacteria ratio in lakes are significantly higher than in marines systems, although there is little trend in the virus-to-bacteria ratio with increasing trophy, and despite the occurrence of more bacteria per unit chlorophyll in lake samples.
   The functional impact of virions on the structure and metabolism of planktonic communities is more important than their quantitative importance, as viruses represent only a minor fraction of the total planktonic biomass. The viral-induced mortality of microbial communities in marine systems is estimated to represent about 30 and < 10 pour 100 of the mortality of bacterio- and phytoplankton, respectively. Based on one study, the contribution of viruses to bacterial mortality in lakes seems considerably lower than in marine systems. The greatest impact of viruses on aquatic communities is likely through hazardous (i.e. non-steady state) processes which are difficult to quantified, such as the promotion of genetic material exchanges among populations and the maintenance of species diversity. The lytic pressure from virulent viruses may act as a ''nonstop'' inductor of modifications in the genetic heritage of host-organisms, thereby increasing the potential of these hosts to share their habitat with homologous species, i.e. with similar nutritional requirements.
   It has recently been shown that lysates resulting from phage infection can caused a significant increase in metabolic activity of noninfected bacterioplankton community, but the growth efficiency of these noninfected hosts decreased in the presence of viruses, likely because of the increase in bacterial energy demand associated with extracellular degradation of polymers that are prevalent in viral lysates. This seems to verify the hypothesis on a substantial contribution of the lytic activity from viruses, to the cycling of organic matter in aquatic systems. Viral lytic production may indeed (1) reduce the bacterial biomass contribution to the transfer of metabolic energy on to higher-order consumers, (2) result in an increase of bacterial secondary production in the absence of an increase in the ambient primary production, and (3) increase competition between bacterial exo- or ectoenzyme activity and the feeding activity of protozoa on high molecular weight polymers (including viruses), although ingestion of viruses by protists seems to be of less importance in the carbon flows through the microbial food web in pelagic systems.
   However, almost all studies on the ecology of pelagic viruses are done during a limited period of year, mainly in marine waters situated in temperate zones. The data discussed in this paper are thus to be considered as preliminary data. Nevertheless, viruses undoubtedly influence to various degrees the biological processes in aquatic ecosystems. The quantitative assessment of their functional impact is thus required for incorporation into models that simulate flues of matter, nutrients and energy in aquatic systems. This task is to be include on the agenda of both marine and freshwater biologists, as a high priority concern for the near future.

AB A mozzarella cheese factory using an undefined, milk-derived Streptacoccus thermophilus starter system was monitored longitudinally for 2 years to determine whether the diversity of the resident bacteriophage population arose from environmental sources or from genetic changes in the resident phage in the factory. The two hypotheses led to different predictions about the genetic diversity of the phages. With respect to host range, 12 distinct phage types were observed. With two exceptions, phages belonging to different lytic groups showed clearly distinct restriction patterns slid multiple isolates of phages showing the same host range exhibited identical or highly related restriction patterns, Sequencing studies in a conserved region of the phage genome revealed no point mutations in multiple isolates of the same phage type, while up to 12% nucleotide sequence diversity was observed between the different phage types. This diversity is as large as that between the most different sequences from phages in our collection. These observations make unlikely a model that postulates a single phage invasion event and diversification of the phage during its residence in the factory, In the second stage of our factory study, a defined starter system was introduced that could not propagate the resident factory phage population, Within a week, three new phage types were observed in the factory while the resident phage population was decreased but not eliminated. Raw milk was the most likely source of these new phages, as phages with identical host ranges and restriction patterns were isolated from raw milk delivered to the factory during the intervention trial. Apparently, all of the genetic diversity observed in the S. thermophilus phages isolated during our survey was already created in their natural environment. A better understanding of the raw-milk ecology of S. thermophilus phages is thus essential for successful practical phage control.

AB An in situ transmission electron microscopic study of biomass samples concentrated from oligotrophic lake water revealed a variety of virus-infected microbial cells and many free viruses and virus-like particles. The most abundant group of microorganisms in screened and filtered water-column samples were 2 mu m or less in diameter, and included representatives of several oligotrophic genera, Prosthecomicrobium, Ancyclobacter, Caulobacter and Hyphomicrobium. Among the prokaryotic host cells, which included both heterotrophs and autotrophs, on the basis of electron microscope observations, approximately 17% were infected with bacteriophage or bore adherent phage particles on their surfaces. Several bacterial morphotypes were observed among the prokaryotic hosts. Water samples passed through a 20-mu m Nitex screen allowed us to concentrate and examine the larger host cells as well, including several species of single-celled algae and two amoeba species. The infected algal cells included those Chlorella-like in appearance, photosynthetic flagellates and others that could not be positively identified. About one-third of the eukaryotic cells were infected by viruses that were larger (150-200 nm) and structurally more complex than bacteriophages (50-60 nm). None of the viruses have been isolated, but when 0.2 mu m filtrate from a biomass sample was spotted onto lawns of four representative heterotrophs and a Chlorella, the clearing observed was taken as evidence of lysis. Cyanobacterial lawns showed no plaques. Thin sections of two amoeba showed food vacuoles containing what appeared to be virus particles of a type seen in certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in the biomass.

AB Five bacteriophages infecting common fluorescent pseudomonads (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida) were isolated from barley rhizosphere soil. Morphological and molecular characteristics of the phages are described together with selected phage-host interactions. All phages belonged to the Myoviridae family with isometrical heads on contractile tails; 4 of them were unusually large and had complex protein and DNA profiles. The large phages had estimated genome sizes of 200 kb or more. Restriction enzyme analyses and DNA-DNA hybridizations showed that all isolates represented different phage species. None of the isolates were observed to establish lysogeny with the main host strain, P. putida MM1. The large phages multiplied slowly on their hosts, producing very small plaques; one-step growth experiments with one of the large phages (Psp 4) hence demonstrated a long latent period (2.5 h) and a very small burst size (10 particles). One of the large phages (Psp 3) was abundant in the rhizosphere (approx. 10(4) pfu g(-1) soil) and had a particularly broad host range which extended to both fluorescent (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida and Pseudomonas chlororaphis) and non-fluorescent (Pseudomonas stutzeri) Pseudomonas spp. occurring in soil. The ecological importance of the large Pseudomonas phages must be further studied, but their slow multiplication rates suggested a possible mechanism of balanced phage-host co-existence in the rhizosphere.

AB Several lytic phages of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (formerly A. viscosus) have been isolated from sewage and from dental plaque. To define the relationships between these phages and ultimately to assess their role in the ecology of the human oral cavity, 13 phages isolated from these two environments were purified and their biochemical properties compared. Five small, short-tailed phages, isolated from sewage over the course of several years (Av-1, Av-2, Av-3, 1281, and BF307) were morphologically indistinguishable from each other and from five phages recovered more recently from human dental plaque (CT1, CT2, CT3, CT6 and CT7). The small phages (all morphotype C1) contained double-stranded linear DNA, 18 kb in size. In contrast, three phages from dental plaque (CT4, CT5 and CT8) possessed longer tails and much larger head structures (morphotype B1). Two of the larger phages (CT4 and CT5) contained DNA genomes estimated to be 80 kb in size, whereas large phage CT8 contained DNA of approximately 50 kb. Restriction endonuclease analysis revealed extensive differences between the large and small phages but the latter group showed similar, and in several cases identical, fragment patterns. These results indicate the existence of at least three distinct types of lytic bacteriophage active against oral Actinomyces spp. The similarities between the sewage and small dental plaque isolates indicate a high degree of relatedness and suggest that the sewage phages probably originated from the oral cavity.

AB A double filtration method for the concentration of viruses from water was developed. The procedure involves prefiltering a water sample through 0.22 mu m and 0.1 mu m filters, concentrating viruses in the 0.1 mu m filtrate using a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off (mwco) filter. In tests utilizing bacteriophage host systems (PHS) isolated from the Chesapeake Bay, this method was shown to have an average recovery efficiency of 76.5% for viable bacteriophage. It was also possible to recover 100% of the virus-like particles observed in natural water samples. The recovery of bacteriophages and virus-like particles using our method compared well with other reported virus concentration methods employing adsorption/elution and ultrafiltration. Furthermore, the procedure is inexpensive and well suited to field applications.

AB A study of Spissipes Section of Culex (Melanoconion) adults behaviour was carried out from August 1992 through December 1993 in human dominated (anthropic) environment in the Ribeira Valley, S.Paulo State, Brazil, By sampling at several sites it the dominance of Culex ribeirensis and Cx. sacchettae became evident even through a total number of ten species was recorded. Those two mosquitoes showed a clear tendency to frequent the domiciliary environment where they were caught, both indoor and outdoor, through the use of the human bait. In the outside environments, the residual patchy forests seems to display a concentration role, from which these adults spread to the open land and reach the dwellings. As their vector competence has been demonstrated through the virus isolations in natural conditions, it is advisable to pay attention to the presence of these mosquitoes in the man-made environment.

AB The extremely halophilic archaea (family Halobacteriaceae) are the dominant heterotrophic organisms in hypersaline environments in which salt concentrations exceed 250-300 g 1(-1). During the last decades our knowledge on the taxonomy, physiology and biochemistry of the Halobacterium group has greatly increased. However, our understanding of the ecology of the halophilic archaea lags far behind the progress made in the study of other aspects of their biology. A few hypersaline environments, such as the Dead Sea and solar salterns, have been studied more in depth, using techniques such as lipid analysis to obtain information on the types of organisms present and measurement of uptake of labeled substrates to quantify the dynamics of bacterial processes. The results of these studies, in combination with the information obtained from laboratory studies of representative isolates of the Halobacteriaceae, enable the beginning of an understanding of the functioning of the halophilic archaea in nature.

AB Isolation and cultivation of marine bacteriophages have shown that they are ubiquitous in seawater, and direct counting has shown that the total numbers of viruses frequently exceed the bacterial concentration by a factor of 10. About 150 different isolates of phages from marine environments have been characterized in the literature reviewed in the present report. Knoblike projections on phage heads seem to be a morphological property more common in marine phages than among phages from other sources. The cultured phages were generally much larger than the majority of viruses observed by direct transmission electron microscopy of seawater samples, indicating that culturing methods are not providing unbiased samples of environmental viruses. Cultured marine viruses frequently are more sensitive to organic solvents than the more intensively studied phages from other sources. Burst sizes from recent in situ studies are 50% lower than the average from culture studies. Phages in the marine environment may have half lives lasting less than a day, with consequent high turnover. Host ranges varies, and cross species host ranges have not been demonstrated. More information and further development of methods are needed, both from culture and from in situ studies.

AB The dynamics of the interaction of populations of Bacillus subtilis and a temperate bacteriophage in soil microorganisms were examined. The purpose of the study was to investigate these dynamics in a structured habitat approaching that of their natural habitat in soil, in contrast to previous investigations in broth or chemostats. We addressed three main questions. What are the population dynamics of a phage-bacteria interaction in soil? What role might the heterogeneity of the soil play in shaping the interaction? Are the dynamics controlled more by the population biology of the phage or of the bacteria?
   The phage used was isolated from Arizona desert soil in which B. subtilis is common. Phage and bacteria were grown separately or together in sterile soil microcosms consisting of autoclaved soil rich in organic material. Densities of phage and bacteria were estimated through repeated sterile sampling of the microcosms by spreading precise dilutions of sampled soil suspensions onto plates of microbiological media. The plates for estimation of phage densities contained in addition a lawn of host bacteria. While the principal focus is on temperate phage ecology, the dynamics of a single example of interaction between B. subtilis and virulent phage is also presented. In all cases an initial epidemic of phage occurred, followed by stable equilibria lasting weeks to months. A threshold host density for phage outbreak occurs at almost-equal-to 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per gram of soil. At equilibrium the phage, both temperate and virulent, were much less abundant than the bacteria. The temperate phage did not depress the equilibrium host density, while the virulent phage lowered it by a factor of ten. The acidic soil of these experiments caused rapid and permanent inactivation of free phage, making the continuous interaction of phage and host essential for persistence of phage. Low levels of phage resistance (superimmunity or genetic) were typical of host populations.
   Most properties of the interaction between B. subtilis and phage in soil are quite different from those observed with chemostat populations of Escherichia coli and virulent phages. Potential doubling times and rates of increase in soil for phage and B. subtilis were calculated. At equilibrium, soil slows the interaction of phage and host relative to population growth in broth culture, and possibly also makes it heterogeneous in space and time. The life-history features of B. subtilis and temperate phage are considerably more complex than those of non-sporeforming bacteria and virulent phage. The biotic relationship of temperate phage and host may be distinct from predation or parasitism. Patterns in the ecology and evolution of temperate and virulent phage were explored, leading to the expectation that temperate forms will be more common among the phages of soil bacteria.

AB Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the low copy number of two 16S ribosomal gene fragments from soil and sediment extracts. Total DNA for polymerase chain reaction was extracted from 1 g of seeded or unseeded samples by a rapid freeze-and-thaw method. Amplified DNA fragments can be detected in DNA fractions isolated from seeded soil containing less than 3 Escherichia coli cells and from seeded sediments containing less than 10 cells. This research demonstrated that coupling polymerase chain reaction to direct DNA extraction improves sensitivity by 1 and 2 orders of magnitude for sediments and soils, respectively. This technique could become a powerful tool for genetic ecology studies.

The efficiency and applicability of the method developed were checked with different samples from a range of sources. The increased chances of development of other genera after the reduction of streptomycetes on soil dilution plates were assessed.

AB Seven clonal isolates of viruses which cause lysis of the eukaryotic, naked, photosynthetic flagellate Micromonas pusilla (Prasinophyceae) were isolated from the coastal waters of New York, Texas, California and British Columbia, as well as the oligotrophic waters of the central Gulf of Mexico, The viruses are large polyhedrons (ca 115 nm dia.) lacking tails, and are morphologically similar to a previously described virus (MPV) which infected M pusilla. Restriction fragment analysis of the DNA from these clones using EcoRI revealed unique banding patterns, demonstrating that each of the clones (including 3 that were isolated from the same water sample) were genetically different. Summation of the 17 to 26 visible fragments from the restriction digests, for each of the clones, yielded estimated genome sizes of 77 to 110 kilobase pairs. In contrast, only 4 different types of viruses could be recognized based on the molecular weights of the major proteins. In field samples the concentrations of viruses causing lysis of M. pusilla were found to be spatially and temporally variable, ranging from < 20 to 4.6 x 10(6) infective units l-1. Our results demonstrate that this genetically diverse but morphologically similar group of viruses is widespread in nature. As viral infections propagate rapidly when host density is high, the presence of these viruses may place constraints on the maximum density that M. pusilla could reach in nature. If viruses infecting other phytoplankton taxa are similarly widespread then they are probably a major factor maintaining diversity in phytoplankton communities, and are also likely important players in nutrient and energy cycling.

AB The adaptations of phytoplankton to life in suspension in water are considered with particular reference to hydromechanical factors ranging from molecular motion to ocean currents. The smallest phytoplankton, the picoplankton (0.2-2.0-mu-m), are the best adapted to the physico-chemical environment of the open waters of seas and lakes and, other things being equal, can out-compete the larger forms. The picophytoplankton are an autotrophic component in a microbial community, the ultraplankton, which also includes bacteria and flagellates up to about 20-mu-m in linear dimensions. This community is a highly dynamic and self-contained equilibrium system operating within a domain dominated by molecular diffusion. Within the photic zone it is limited, not by nutrient supply, but by its internal predator-prey relationships. It appears to be cosmopolitan, both in the sea and in freshwaters, to vary little either in time or space in species composition or in biomass concentration, and to contribute a minimum of organic carbon to higher trophic levels. There appears to be a fundamental divide in form and function between this and the microplankton, composed of organisms larger than about 20-mu-m. This community can only develop when nutrient levels are in excess of the concentrations required by the picoplankton. It is opportunistic, non-equilibrium in its dynamics, and highly variable in floristic composition and biomass concentration. Its life processes are dominated by turbulence. Nutrient supply is largely determined by turbulent eddy diffusion and movement of the organisms relative to the water mass. The microphytoplankton falls broadly into two types, one of which, exemplified by the diatoms, depends on turbulence to maintain it in the photic zone and the other, exemplified by the dinoflagellates and colony-forming cyanobacteria, relies on motility or buoyancy control to position it in a relatively stable water column so as to have best access to light and nutrients. The waxing and waning of microplankton populations is largely determined by hydrography and their floristic compositions by the interactions of the daily and seasonal rhythms of the organisms with the periodicities in the environment. In contrast to the ultraplankton microplankton species show distinct differences in biogeographical distribution. Throughout the discussion attention is drawn to the intimate relationships between the activities of phytoplankton and those of viruses, bacteria and zooplankton and the impossibility of getting a proper understanding of the physiology of the phytoplankton if they are considered in isolation.
