AB Aims Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are ecologically important group of anaerobic micro-organisms that can reduce sulphate to form hydrogen sulphide-a toxic gas causing iron corrosion on metal surfaces. In this work, SRB strains were isolated from aquatic environments in the country of Georgia to determine their lysogenicity and the role of temperate phages in host metabolism.
   Methods and Results SRB strains were isolated in samples from the Black Sea coast of Georgia. Based on their genetic, cytological and physiological properties of bacteria, 10 Georgian isolates were assigned to the genus Desulfovibrio. Temperate bacteriophages were induced from three out of ten strains by UV-exposure. Comparison of metal (Fe and Cr) reduction and utilization of various carbon sources by the wild-type (lysogenic) bacterial strains and their UV-irradiated counterparts was done.
   Conclusions Temperate phage in the cells of SRB could alter significant functions of bacteria and may have a contribution in the acquisition of different traits by SRB.
   Significance and Impact of the Study This article pointed to a significant role for temperate bacteriophages in the metabolism and metabolic potential of host strains of SRB, which were first isolated from the aquatic environment of Georgia.

TI Interaction dynamics and virus-host range for estuarine actinophages
   captured by epicPCR
SO NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Using epicPCR, a method that fuses a phage marker gene with the 16S rRNA gene of infected bacterial cells at single-cell resolution, the authors identify host-virus interactions and dynamics over time in an estuarine environment.
   Viruses impact microbial diversity, gene flow and function through virus-host interactions. Although metagenomics surveys are rapidly cataloguing viral diversity, methods are needed to capture specific virus-host interactions in situ. Here, we leveraged metagenomics and repurposed emulsion paired isolation-concatenation PCR (epicPCR) to investigate viral diversity and virus-host interactions in situ over time in an estuarine environment. The method fuses a phage marker, the ribonucleotide reductase gene, with the host 16S rRNA gene of infected bacterial cells within emulsion droplets providing single-cell resolution for dozens of samples. EpicPCR captured in situ virus-host interactions for viral clades with no closely related database representatives. Abundant freshwater Actinobacteria lineages, in particular Rhodoluna sp., were the most common hosts for these poorly characterized viruses, with interactions correlated with environmental factors. Multiple methods used to identify virus-host interactions, including epicPCR, identified different and largely non-overlapping interactions within the vast virus-host interaction space. Tracking virus-host interaction dynamics also revealed that multi-host viruses had significantly longer periods with observed virus-host interactions, whereas single-host viruses were observed interacting with hosts at lower minimum abundances, suggesting more efficient interactions. Capturing in situ interactions with epicPCR revealed environmental and ecological factors shaping virus-host interactions, highlighting epicPCR as a valuable technique in viral ecology.

AB Understanding the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in adaptation is a key challenge in evolutionary biology. In microbes, an important mechanism of HGT is prophage acquisition (phage genomes integrated into bacterial chromosomes). Prophages can influence bacterial fitness via the transfer of beneficial genes (including antibiotic-resistance genes, ARGs), protection from superinfecting phages, or switching to a lytic lifecycle that releases free phages infectious to competitors. We expect these effects to depend on environmental conditions because of, for example, environment-dependent induction of the lytic lifecycle. However, it remains unclear how costs/benefits of prophages vary across environments. Here, studying prophages with/without ARGs in Escherichia coli, we disentangled the effects of prophages alone and adaptive genes they carry. In competition with prophage-free strains, benefits from prophages and ARGs peaked in different environments. Prophages were most beneficial when induction of the lytic lifecycle was common, whereas ARGs were more beneficial upon antibiotic exposure and with reduced prophage induction. Acquisition of prophage-encoded ARGs by competing strains was most common when prophage induction, and therefore free phages, were common. Thus, selection on prophages and adaptive genes they carry varies independently across environments, which is important for predicting the spread of mobile/integrating genetic elements and their role in evolution.

AB Phages are generally described as species specific or even strain specific, implying an inherent limitation for some to be maintained and spread in diverse bacterial communities. Moreover, phage isolation and host range determination rarely consider the phage ecological context, likely biasing our notion on phage specificity. Here we isolated and characterized a novel group of six promiscuous phages, named Atoyac, existing in rivers and sewage by using a diverse collection of over 600 bacteria retrieved from the same environments as potential hosts. These podophages isolated from different regions in Mexico display a remarkably broad host range, infecting bacteria from six genera: Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Yersinia, Hafnia, Escherichia, and Serratia. Atoyac phage genomes are similar to 42 kb long and highly similar to each other, but not to those currently available in genome and metagenome public databases. Detailed comparison of the phages' efficiency of plating (EOP) revealed variation among bacterial genera, implying a cost associated with infection of distant hosts, and between phages, despite their sequence similarity. We show, through experimental evolution in single or alternate hosts of different genera, that efficiency of plaque production is highly dynamic and tends toward optimization in hosts rendering low plaque formation. However, adaptation to distinct hosts differed between similar phages; whereas one phage optimized its EOP in all tested hosts, the other reduced plaque production in one host, suggesting that propagation in multiple bacteria may be key to maintain promiscuity in some viruses. Our study expands our knowledge of the virosphere and uncovers bacteriumphage interactions overlooked in natural systems.
   IMPORTANCE In natural environments, phages coexist and interact with a broad variety of bacteria, posing a conundrum for narrow-host-range phage maintenance in diverse communities. This context is rarely considered in the study of host-phage interactions, typically focused on narrow-host-range viruses and their infectivity in target bacteria isolated from sources distinct to where the phages were retrieved from. By studying phage-host interactions in bacteria and viruses isolated from river microbial communities, we show that novel phages with promiscuous host range encompassing multiple bacterial genera can be found in the environment. Assessment of hundreds of interactions in diverse hosts revealed that similar phages exhibit different infection efficiency and adaptation patterns. Understanding host range is fundamental in our knowledge of bacterium-phage interactions and their impact on microbial communities. The dynamic nature of phage promiscuity revealed in our study has implications in different aspects of phage research such as horizontal gene transfer or phage therapy.

AB Background Ponds are important freshwater habitats that support both human and environmental activities. However, relative to their larger counterparts (e.g. rivers, lakes), ponds are understudied, especially with regard to their microbial communities. Our study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by using culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing to assess the dynamics, taxonomy, and functionality of bacterial and viral communities in a freshwater agricultural pond. Results Water samples (n = 14) were collected from a Mid-Atlantic agricultural pond between June 2017 and May 2018 and filtered sequentially through 1 and 0.2 mu m filter membranes. Total DNA was then extracted from each filter, pooled, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Additionally, on eight occasions water filtrates were processed for viral metagenomes (viromes) using chemical concentration and then shotgun sequenced. A ubiquitous freshwater phylum, Proteobacteria was abundant at all sampling dates throughout the year. However, environmental characteristics appeared to drive the structure of the community. For instance, the abundance of Cyanobacteria (e.g. Nostoc) increased with rising water temperatures, while a storm event appeared to trigger an increase in overall bacterial diversity, as well as the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. This event was also associated with an increase in the number of antibiotic resistance genes. The viral fractions were dominated by dsDNA of the order Caudovirales, namely Siphoviridae and Myovirdae. Conclusions Overall, this study provides one of the largest datasets on pond water microbial ecology to date, revealing seasonal trends in the microbial taxonomic composition and functional potential.

AB A prerequisite to improve the predictability of microbial community dynamics is to understand the mechanisms of microbial assembly. To study factors that contribute to microbial community assembly, we examined the temporal dynamics of genes in five aquatic metagenome time-series, originating from marine offshore or coastal sites and one lake. With this trait-based approach we expected to find gene-specific patterns of temporal allele variability that depended on the seasonal metacommunity size of carrier-taxa and the variability of the milieu and the substrates to which the resulting proteins were exposed. In more detail, we hypothesized that a larger seasonal metacommunity size would result in increased temporal variability of functional units (i.e., gene alleles), as shown previously for taxonomic units. We further hypothesized that multicopy genes would feature higher temporal variability than single-copy genes, as gene multiplication can result from high variability in substrate quality and quantity. Finally, we hypothesized that direct exposure of proteins to the extracellular environment would result in increased temporal variability of the respective gene compared to intracellular proteins that are less exposed to environmental fluctuations. The first two hypotheses were confirmed in all data sets, while significant effects of the subcellular location of gene products was only seen in three of the five time-series. The gene with the highest allele variability throughout all data sets was an iron transporter, also representing a target for phage infection. Previous work has emphasized the role of phage-prokaryote interactions as a major driver of microbial diversity. Our finding therefore points to a potentially important role of iron transporter-mediated phage infections for the assembly and maintenance of diversity in aquatic prokaryotes.

AB The religious mass gathering and bathing can pose a multitude of significant public health challenges and lead to severe alterations in the river microbial ecology. The Pandharpur Wari is an annual pilgrimage of Maharashtra, India, where millions of devotees carry the footprints of the saint-poets and pay their obeisance to Lord Vitthal on the 11th day of moon's waxing phase (Ashadi Ekadashi). As a part of the ritual, the engrossed devotees, walk over 250 km, take a first holy dip in a sacred river Indrayani at Alandi and secondly in Bhima River at Pandharpur. The MinION-based shotgun metagenomic approach was employed to examine the impact of spiritual mass bathing on environmental changes (concerning the river microbial community structure and functions); and public health aspects (in terms of changes in the pathogenic potential and antibiotic resistance). The analysis of bathing and post-bathing samples of both the rivers revealed alterations in the alpha and beta diversity, indicating significant spatiotemporal variations in the overall microbial structure and function. Furthermore, the analysis revealed up to 80% of differences in the abundance of virulence genes between the bathing and post bathing samples. We observed parallel increase of priority skin and enteric pathogens (ranging from 11% to 80%) such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa during the bathing event. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the antibiotic resistance in the bathing samples of Bhima and Indrayani rivers respectively. Altogether, this is the first comprehensive metagenomic study unravelling the influence of religious mass-bathing on the riverine ecosystem.

AB Temperate phages can associate with their bacterial host to form a lysogen, often modifying the phenotype of the host. Lysogens are dominant in the microbially dense environment of the mammalian gut. This observation contrasts with the long-standing hypothesis of lysogeny being favored at low microbial densities, such as in oligotrophic marine environments. Here, we hypothesized that phage coinfections-a well-understood molecular mechanism of lysogenization-increase at high microbial abundances. To test this hypothesis, we developed a biophysical model of coinfection for marine and gut microbiomes. The model stochastically sampled ranges of phage and bacterial concentrations, adsorption rates, lysogenic commitment times, and community diversity from each environment. In 90% of the sampled marine communities, less than 10% of the bacteria were predicted to be lysogenized via coinfection. In contrast, 25% of the sampled gut communities displayed more than 25% of lysogenization. The probability of lysogenization in the gut was a consequence of the higher densities and higher adsorption rates. These results suggest that, on average, coinfections can form two trillion lysogens in the human gut every day. In marine microbiomes, which were characterized by lower densities and phage adsorption rates, lysogeny via coinfection was still possible for communities with long lysogenic commitment times. Our study indicates that different physical factors causing coinfections can reconcile the traditional view of lysogeny at poor host growth (long commitment times) and the recent Piggyback-the-Winner framework proposing that lysogeny is favored in rich environments (high densities and adsorption rates).
   IMPORTANCE The association of temperate phages and bacterial hosts during lysogeny manipulates microbial dynamics from the oceans to the human gut. Lysogeny is well studied in laboratory models, but its environmental drivers remain unclear. Here, we quantified the probability of lysogenization caused by phage coinfections, a well-known trigger of lysogeny, in marine and gut microbial environments. Coinfections were quantified by developing a biophysical model that incorporated the traits of viral and bacterial communities. Lysogenization via coinfection was more frequent in highly productive environments like the gut, due to higher microbial densities and higher phage adsorption rates. At low cell densities, lysogenization occurred in bacteria with long duplication times. These results bridge the molecular understanding of lysogeny with the ecology of complex microbial communities.

AB Vibrio choleraenon-O1, non-O139 bacteria are natural inhabitants of aquatic ecosystems and have been sporadically associated with human infections. They mostly lack the two major virulence factors of toxigenicV. choleraeserogroups O1 and O139 strains, which are the causative agent of cholera. Non-O1, non-O139 strains are found in water bodies, sediments, and in association with other aquatic organisms. Occurrence of these bacteria in fecal specimens of waterfowl were reported, and migratory birds likely contribute to the long-distance transfer of strains. We investigated fourV. choleraenon-O1, non-O139 isolates for phenotypic traits and by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The isolates were recovered from organs of domestic ducks with serious disease symptoms. WGS data revealed only a distant genetic relationship between all isolates. The isolates harbored a number of virulence factors found in mostV. choleraestrains. Specific virulence factors of non-O1, non-O139 strains, such as the type III secretion system (TTSS) or cholix toxin, were observed. An interesting observation is that all isolates possess multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin toxins (MARTX) closely related to the MARTX of toxigenic El Tor O1 strains. Different primary sequences of the abundant OmpU proteins could indicate a significant role of this virulence factor. Phenotypic characteristics such as hemolysis and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were studied. Three isolates showed susceptibility to a number of tested antimicrobials, and one strain possessed AMR genes located in an integron. Knowledge of the environmental occurrence ofV. choleraenon-O1, non-O139 in Germany is limited. The source of the infection of the ducks is currently unknown. In the context of the 'One Health' concept, it is desirable to study the ecology ofV. choleraenon-O1, non-O139, as it cannot be excluded that the isolates possess zoonotic potential and could cause infections in humans.

AB The study of soil viruses, though not new, has languished relative to the study of marine viruses. This is particularly due to challenges associated with separating virions from harboring soils. Generally, three approaches to analyzing soil viruses have been employed: (1) Isolation, to characterize virus genotypes and phenotypes, the primary method used prior to the start of the 21st century. (2) Metagenomics, which has revealed a vast diversity of viruses while also allowing insights into viral community ecology, although with limitations due to DNA from cellular organisms obscuring viral DNA. (3) Viromics (targeted metagenomics of virus-like-particles), which has provided a more focused development of 'virus-sequence-to-ecology' pipelines, a result of separation of presumptive virions from cellular organisms prior to DNA extraction. This separation permits greater sequencing emphasis on virus DNA and thereby more targeted molecular and ecological characterization of viruses. Employing viromics to characterize soil systems presents new challenges, however. Ones that only recently are being addressed. Here we provide a guide to implementing these three approaches to studying environmental viruses, highlighting benefits, difficulties, and potential contamination, all toward fostering greater focus on viruses in the study of soil ecology.

AB Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is characterized by diffuse villous atrophy of the small bowel. EED is strongly associated with stunting, a major public health problem linked to increased childhood morbidity and mortality. EED and subsequent stunting of linear growth are surmised to have microbial origins. To interrogate this relationship, we defined the comprehensive virome (eukaryotic virus and bacteriophage) and bacterial microbiome of a longitudinal cohort of rural Malawian children with extensive metadata and intestinal permeability testing at each time point. We found thirty bacterial taxa differentially associated with linear growth. We detected many eukaryotic viruses. Neither the total number of eukaryotic families nor a specific viral family was statistically associated with improved linear growth. We identified 3 differentially abundant bacteriophage among growth velocities. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between bacteria and bacteriophage richness in children with subsequent adequate/moderate growth which children with subsequent poor growth lacked. This suggests that a disruption in the equilibrium between bacteria and bacteriophage communities might be associated with subsequent poor growth. Future studies of EED and stunting should include the evaluation of viral communities in addition to bacterial microbiota to understand the complete microbial ecology of these poorly understood entities.
   Author summary Stunting (poor linear growth) is a major global problem. Stunting affects one-third of the half-billion preschool children in low and middle-income countries and is associated with similar to 20% of all-cause deaths before age five. Stunting is believed to be a consequence of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED). EED is a gut inflammatory process that is endemic in children living in low and middle-income countries. EED and, by extension, stunting are thought to have microbial origins. However, attempts to find specific pathogens that drive (or protect from) EED have not been fruitful. Here, we define the comprehensive gut virome, which includes viruses that infect humans and animals and viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophage) and the bacterial gut microbiome in rural Malawian children. These participants are very well characterized (with careful growth measurements and intestinal permeability testing), enabling us to more precisely correlate the populations of viruses and bacteria in their stool with how well, or how poorly, the children are growing. We found thirty bacterial species and three bacteriophage that were differentially associated with linear growth in the three months after sampling. We found a positive correlation between bacteria and bacteriophage richness in children with subsequent adequate and moderate linear growth which children with subsequent poor growth lacked. Our data suggest that disrupting the bacteria-bacteriophage equilibrium between bacteria and bacteriophage communities might impair childhood linear growth.

AB Bacteriophages are abundant members of all microbiomes studied to date, influencing microbial communities through interactions with their bacterial hosts. Despite their functional importance and ubiquity, phages have been underexplored in urban environments compared to their bacterial counterparts. We profiled the viral communities in New York City (NYC) wastewater using metagenomic data collected in November 2014 from 14 wastewater treatment plants. We show that phages accounted for the largest viral component of the sewage samples and that specific virus communities were associated with local environmental conditions within boroughs. The vast majority of the virus sequences had no homology matches in public databases, forming an average of 1,700 unique virus clusters (putative genera). These new clusters contribute to elucidating the overwhelming proportion of data that frequently goes unidentified in viral metagenomic studies. We assigned potential hosts to these phages, which appear to infect a wide range of bacterial genera, often outside their presumed host. We determined that infection networks form a modular-nested pattern, indicating that phages include a range of host specificities, from generalists to specialists, with most interactions organized into distinct groups. We identified genes in viral contigs involved in carbon and sulfur cycling, suggesting functional importance of viruses in circulating pathways and gene functions in the wastewater environment. In addition, we identified virophage genes as well as a nearly complete novel virophage genome. These findings provide an understanding of phage abundance and diversity in NYC wastewater, previously uncharacterized, and further examine geographic patterns of phagehost association in urban environments.
   IMPORTANCE Wastewater is a rich source of microbial life and contains bacteria, viruses, and other microbes found in human waste as well as environmental runoff sources. As part of an effort to characterize the New York City wastewater metagenome, we profiled the viral community of sewage samples across all five boroughs of NYC and found that local sampling sites have unique sets of viruses. We focused on bacteriophages, or viruses of bacteria, to understand how they may influence the microbial ecology of this system. We identified several new clusters of phages and successfully associated them with bacterial hosts, providing insight into virus-host interactions in urban wastewater. This study provides a first look into the viral communities present across the wastewater system in NYC and points to their functional importance in this environment.

AB Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and play key roles in host ecology, evolution, and horizontal gene transfer. Despite recent progress in viral metagenomics, the inherent genetic complexity of virus populations still poses technical difficulties for recovering complete virus genomes from natural assemblages. To address these challenges, we developed an assembly-free, single-molecule nanopore sequencing approach, enabling direct recovery of complete virus genome sequences from environmental samples. Our method yielded thousands of full-length, high-quality draft virus genome sequences that were not recovered using standard short-read assembly approaches. Additionally, our analyses discriminated between populations whose genomes had identical direct terminal repeats versus those with circularly permuted repeats at their termini, thus providing new insight into native virus reproduction and genome packaging. Novel DNA sequences were discovered, whose repeat structures, gene contents, and concatemer lengths suggest they are phage-inducible chromosomal islands, which are packaged as concatemers in phage particles, with lengths that match the size ranges of co-occurring phage genomes. Our new virus sequencing strategy can provide previously unavailable information about the genome structures, population biology, and ecology of naturally occurring viruses and viral parasites.

AB Dynamic virus-host interactions play a critical role in regulating microbial community structure and function. Yet for decades prior to the genomics era, viruses were largely overlooked in microbial ecology research, as only low-throughput culture-based methods of discovering viruses were available. With the advent of metagenomics, culture-independent techniques have provided exciting opportunities to discover and study new viruses. Here, we review recently developed computational methods for identifying viral sequences, exploring viral diversity in environmental samples, and predicting hosts from metagenomic sequence data. Methods to analyze viruses in silico utilize unconventional approaches to tackle challenges unique to viruses, such as vast diversity, mosaic viral genomes, and the lack of universal marker genes. As the field of viral ecology expands exponentially, computational advances have become increasingly important to gain insight into the role viruses in diverse habitats. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB The Namib Desert is one of the world's only truly coastal desert ecosystem. Until the end of the 1st decade of the twenty-first century, very little was known of the microbiology of this southwestern African desert, with the few reported studies being based solely on culture-dependent approaches. However, from 2010, an intense research program was undertaken by researchers from the University of the Western Cape Institute for Microbial Biotechnology and Metagenomics, and subsequently the University of Pretoria Centre for Microbial Ecology and Genomics, and their collaborators, led to a more detailed understanding of the ecology of the indigenous microbial communities in many Namib Desert biotopes. Namib Desert soils and the associated specialized niche communities are inhabited by a wide array of prokaryotic, lower eukaryotic and virus/phage taxa. These communities are highly heterogeneous on both small and large spatial scales, with community composition impacted by a range of macro- and micro-environmental factors, from water regime to soil particle size. Community functionality is also surprisingly non-homogeneous, with some taxa retaining functionality even under hyper-arid soil conditions, and with subtle changes in gene expression and phylotype abundances even on diel timescales. Despite the growing understanding of the structure and function of Namib Desert microbiomes, there remain enormous gaps in our knowledge. We have yet to quantify many of the processes in these soil communities, from regional nutrient cycling to community growth rates. Despite the progress that has been made, we still have little knowledge of either the role of phages in microbial community dynamics or inter-species interactions. Furthermore, the intense research efforts of the past decade have highlighted the immense scope for future microbiological research in this dynamic, enigmatic and charismatic region of Africa.

AB Background Viruses of Archaea and Bacteria are among the most abundant and diverse biological entities on Earth. Unraveling their biodiversity has been challenging due to methodological limitations. Recent advances in culture-independent techniques, such as metagenomics, shed light on the unknown viral diversity, revealing thousands of new viral nucleotide sequences at an unprecedented scale. However, these novel sequences have not been properly classified and the evolutionary associations between them were not resolved. Results Here, we performed phylogenomic analysis of nearly 200,000 viral nucleotide sequences to establish GL-UVAB: Genomic Lineages of Uncultured Viruses of Archaea and Bacteria. The pan-genome content of the identified lineages shed light on some of their infection strategies, potential to modulate host physiology, and mechanisms to escape host resistance systems. Furthermore, using GL-UVAB as a reference database for annotating metagenomes revealed elusive habitat distribution patterns of viral lineages and environmental drivers of community composition. Conclusions These findings provide insights about the genomic diversity and ecology of viruses of prokaryotes. The source code used in these analyses is freely available at .

AB Viruses impact nearly all organisms on Earth, with ripples of influence in agriculture, health, and biogeochemical processes. However, very little is known about RNA viruses in an environmental context, and even less is known about their diversity and ecology in soil, 1 of the most complex microbial systems. Here, we assembled 48 individual metatranscriptomes from 4 habitats within a planted soil sampled over a 22-d time series: Rhizosphere alone, detritosphere alone, rhizosphere with added root detritus, and unamended soil (4 time points and 3 biological replicates). We resolved the RNA viral community, uncovering a high diversity of viral sequences. We also investigated possible host organisms by analyzing metatranscriptome marker genes. Based on viral phylogeny, much of the diversity was Narnaviridae that may parasitize fungi or Leviviridae, which may infect Proteobacteria. Both host and viral communities appear to be highly dynamic, and rapidly diverged depending on experimental conditions. The viral and host communities were structured based on the presence of root litter. Clear temporal dynamics by Leviviridae and their hosts indicated that viruses were replicating. With this time-resolved analysis, we show that RNA viruses are diverse, abundant, and active in soil. When viral infection causes host cell death, it may mobilize cell carbon in a process that may represent an overlooked component of soil carbon cycling.

AB Being non-lytic, filamentous phages can replicate at high frequencies and often carry virulence factors, which are important in the evolution and emergence of novel pathogens. However, their net effect on bacterial fitness remains unknown. To understand the ecology and evolution between filamentous phages and their hosts, it is important to assess (i) fitness effects of filamentous phages on their hosts and (ii) how these effects depend on the environment. To determine how the net effect on bacterial fitness by filamentous phages changes across environments, we constructed phage-bacteria infection networks at ambient 15 practical salinity units (PSU) and stressful salinities (11 and 7 PSU) using the marine bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus and its derived filamentous phages as model system. We observed no significant difference in network structure at 15 and 11 PSU. However, at 7 PSU phages significantly reduced bacterial growth changing network structure. This pattern was mainly driven by a significant increase in bacterial susceptibility. Our findings suggest that filamentous phages decrease bacterial growth, an indirect measure of fitness in stressful environmental conditions, which might impact bacterial communities, alter horizontal gene transfer events and possibly favour the emergence of novel pathogens in environmental Vibrios.

AB Huanglongbing disease (HLB; yellow shoot disease) is a severe worldwide infectious disease for citrus family plants. The pathogen "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus" is an alphaproteobacterium of the Rhizobiaceae family that has been identified as the causative agent of HLB. The virulence of "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" has been attributed, in part, to prophage-carried genes. Prophage and prophage-like elements have been identified in 12 of the 15 available "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" genomes and are classified into three prophage types. Here, we reexamined all 15 "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" genomes using a de novo prediction approach and expanded the number of prophage-like elements from 16 to 33. Further, we found that all of the "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" genomes contained at least one prophage-like sequence. Comparative analysis revealed a prevalent, albeit previously unknown, prophage-like sequence type that is a remnant of an integrated prophage. Notably, this remnant prophage is found in the Ishi-1 "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" strain that had previously been reported as lacking prophages. Our findings provide both a resource for data and new insights into the evolutionary relationship between phage and "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" pathogenicity.
   IMPORTANCE Huanglongbing (HLB) disease is threatening citrus production worldwide. The causative agent is "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus." Prior work using mapping-based approaches identified prophage-like sequences in some "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" genomes but not all. Here, we utilized a de novo approach that expands the number of prophage-like elements found in "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" from 16 to 33 and identified at least one prophage-like sequence in all "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" strains. Furthermore, we identified a prophage-like sequence type that is a remnant of an integrated prophage-expanding the number of prophage types in "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus" from 3 to 4. Overall, the findings will help researchers investigate the role of prophage in the ecology, evolution, and pathogenicity of "Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus."

AB Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus species are relevant human commensals and opportunistic pathogens. Consequently, their bacteriophages may have significant impact on human microbial ecology and pathologies. Our aim was to reveal the prevalence and diversity of bacteriophages infecting Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus species that colonize the human body. Genome mining with comparative genomics, screening of clinical isolates, and profiling of metagenomes allowed characterization of 346 phages grouped in 52 clusters and 18 superclusters. Less than 10% of the identified phage clusters were represented by previously characterized phages. Prophage diversity patterns varied significantly for different phage types, host clades, and environmental niches. A more diverse phage community lysogenizes Haemophilus infiuenzae and Haemophilus parainfiuenzae strains than Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and "Haemophilus ducreyi". Co-infections occurred more often in "H. ducreyi". Phages from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans preferably lysogenized strains of specific serotype. Prophage patterns shared by subspecies clades of different bacterial species suggest similar ecoevolutionary drivers. Changes in frequencies of DNA uptake signal sequences and guanine-cytosine content reflect phage-host long-term coevolution. Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus phages were prevalent at multiple oral sites. Together, these findings should help exploring the ecoevolutionary forces shaping virus-host interactions in the human microbiome. Putative lytic phages, especially phiKZ-like, may provide new therapeutic options.

AB While functional gene arrays (FGAs) have greatly expanded our understanding of complex microbial systems, specificity, sensitivity, and quantitation challenges remain. We developed a new generation of FGA, GeoChip 5.0, using the Agilent platform. Two formats were created, a smaller format (GeoChip 5.0S), primarily covering carbon-, nitrogen-, sulfur-, and phosphorus-cycling genes and others providing ecological services, and a larger format (GeoChip 5.0M) containing the functional categories involved in biogeochemical cycling of C, N, S, and P and various metals, stress response, microbial defense, electron transport, plant growth promotion, virulence, gyr13, and fungus-, protozoan-, and virus-specific genes. GeoChip 5.0M contains 161,961 oligonucleotide probes covering >365,000 genes of 1,447 gene families from broad, functionally divergent taxonomic groups, including bacteria (2,721 genera), archaea (101 genera), fungi (297 genera), protists (219 genera), and viruses (167 genera), mainly phages. Computational and experimental evaluation indicated that designed probes were highly specific and could detect as little as 0.05 ng of pure culture DNAs within a background of 1 mu g community DNA (equivalent to 0.005% of the population). Additionally, strong quantitative linear relationships were observed between signal intensity and amount of pure genomic (similar to 99% of probes detected; r > 0.9) or soil (similar to 97%; r > 0.9) DNAs. Application of the GeoChip to a contaminated groundwater microbial community indicated that environmental contaminants (primarily heavy metals) had significant impacts on the biodiversity of the communities. This is the most comprehensive FGA to date, capable of directly linking microbial genes/populations to ecosystem functions.
   IMPORTANCE The rapid development of metagenomic technologies, including microarrays, over the past decade has greatly expanded our understanding of complex microbial systems. However, because of the ever-expanding number of novel microbial sequences discovered each year, developing a microarray that is representative of real microbial communities, is specific and sensitive, and provides quantitative information remains a challenge. The newly developed GeoChip 5.0 is the most comprehensive microarray available to date for examining the functional capabilities of microbial communities important to biogeochemistry, ecology, environmental sciences, and human health. The GeoChip 5 is highly specific, sensitive, and quantitative based on both computational and experimental assays. Use of the array on a contaminated groundwater sample provided novel insights on the impacts of environmental contaminants on groundwater microbial communities.

AB The host range of phages is a key to understand their impact on bacterial ecology and evolution. Because of the complexity of phage-host interactions, the variables that determine the breadth of a phage host range remain poorly understood. Here, we propose a novel holistic approach to identify the host range determinants of a new collection of phages infecting Salmonella, isolated from animal, environmental and wastewater samples that were able to infect 58 of the 71 Salmonella strains in our collection. By using a set of statistic approaches (non-metric dimensional scaling, Bray-Curtis distance, PERMANOVA), we analysed phenotypic (host range on wild-type and receptor mutants) and genetic data (taxonomic assignment and receptor binding proteins) to evaluate the impact of isolation strain and niche, phage receptor and genus on the host range. Statistical analysis revealed that two phage characteristics influence the host range by explaining the most variance: the receptor by 45% and the genus by 51%. Interestingly, phage genus and receptor in combination explained 79% of the variance, establishing these characteristics as the major determinants of the host range. This study demonstrates the power and the novelty of applying statistical approaches to phenotypic and genetic data to investigate the ecology of phage-host interactions.

AB In Antarctic coastal waters where nutrient limitations are low, viruses are expected to play a major role in the regulation of bloom events. Despite this, research in viral identification and dynamics is scarce, with limited information available for the Southern Ocean (SO). This study presents an integrative-omics approach, comparing variation in the viral and microbial active communities on two contrasting sample conditions from a diatom-dominated phytoplankton bloom occurring in Chile Bay in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) in the summer of 2014. The known viral community, initially dominated by Myoviridae family (similar to 82% of the total assigned reads), changed to become dominated by Phycodnaviridae (similar to 90%), while viral activity was predominantly driven by dsDNA members of the Phycodnaviridae (similar to 50%) and diatom infecting ssRNA viruses (similar to 38%), becoming more significant as chlorophyll a increased. A genomic and phylogenetic characterization allowed the identification of a new viral lineage within the Myoviridae family. This new lineage of viruses infects Pseudoalteromonas and was dominant in the phage community. In addition, a new Phycodnavirus (PaV) was described, which is predicted to infect Phaeocystis antarctica, the main blooming haptophyte in the SO. This work was able to identify the changes in the main viral players during a bloom development and suggests that the changes observed in the virioplankton could be used as a model to understand the development and decay of blooms that occur throughout the WAP.

AB The occurrence of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 during a non-outbreak period in Lake Victoria was studied and genetic characteristics for environmental persistence and relatedness to pandemic strains were assessed. We analyzed 360 samples of carps, phytoplankton and water collected in 2017 during dry and rainy seasons in the Tanzanian basin of Lake Victoria. Samples were tested using PCR (ompW and ctxA) with DNA extracted from bacterial isolates and samples enriched in alkaline peptone water. Isolates were screened with polyvalent antiserum O1 followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools were employed to investigate the genomic characteristics of the isolates. More V. cholerae positive samples were recovered by PCR when DNA was obtained from enriched samples than from isolates (69.0% vs. 21.3%, p < 0.05), irrespectively of season. We identified ten V. cholerae O1 among 22 ctxA-positive isolates. Further studies are needed to serotype the remaining ctxA-positive non-O1 strains. Sequenced strains belonged to El Tor atypical biotype of V. cholerae O1 of MLST ST69 harboring the seventh pandemic gene. Major virulence genes, ctxA, ctxB, zot, ace, tcpA, hlyA, rtxA, ompU, toxR, T6SS, alsD, makA and pathogenicity islands VPI-1, VPI-2, VSP-1, and VSP-2 were found in all strains. The strains contained Vibrio polysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes, the mshA gene and two-component response regulator proteins involved in stress response and autoinducers for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. They carried the SXT integrative conjugative element with phenotypic and genotypic resistance to aminoglycoside, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, phenicol, and quinolones. Strains contained a multidrug efflux pump component and were resistant to toxic compounds with copper homeostasis and cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance proteins. The environmental strains belonged to the third wave of the seventh pandemic and most are genetically closely related to recent outbreak strains from Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda with as low as three SNPs difference. Some strains have persisted longer in the environment and were more related to older outbreak strains in the region. V. cholerae O1 of outbreak potential seem to persist in Lake Victoria through interactions with fish and phytoplankton supported by the optimum water parameters and intrinsic genetic features enhancing survival in the aquatic environment.

AB Phages greatly influence the ecology and evolution of their bacterial hosts; however, compared to hosts, a relatively low number of phages, especially halophilic phages, have been studied. This study describes a comparative investigation of physicochemical tolerance between a strain of the halophilic bacterium, Salicola, isolated from the Cargill Saltworks (Newark, CA, USA) and its associated phage. The host grew in media between pH 6-8.5, had a salinity growth optimum of 20% total salts (ranging from 10%-30%) and an upper temperature growth limit of 48 degrees C. The host utilized 61 of 190 substrates tested using BIOLOG Phenotype MicroArrays. The CG phi 29 phage, one of only four reported Salicola phages, is a DNA virus of the Siphoviridae family. Overall, the phage tolerated a broader range of environmental conditions than its host (salinity 0-30% total salts; pH 3-9; upper thermal limit 80 degrees C) and is the most thermotolerant halophilic phage ever reported. This study is the most comprehensive investigation to date of a Salicola host-phage pair and provides novel insights into extreme environmental tolerances among bacteriophages.

AB Viruses are thought to control bacterial abundance, affect community composition and influence ecosystem function in natural environments. Yet their dynamics have seldom been studied in engineered systems, or indeed in any system, for long periods of time. We measured virus abundance in a full-scale activated sludge plant every week for two years. Total bacteria and ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) abundances, bacterial community profiles, and a suite of environmental and operational parameters were also monitored. Mixed liquor virus abundance fluctuated over an order of magnitude (3.18 x 10(8) -3.41 x 10 virus's mL(-1)) and that variation was statistically significantly associated with total bacterial and AOB abundance, community composition, and effluent concentrations of COD and NH4+-N and thus system function. This suggests viruses play a far more important role in the dynamics of activated sludge systems than previously realised and could be one of the key factors controlling bacterial abundance, community structure and functional stability and may cause reactors to fail. These findings are based on statistical associations, not mechanistic models. Nevertheless, viral associations with abiotic factors, such as pH, make physical sense, giving credence to these findings and highlighting the role that physical factors play in virus ecology. Further work is needed to identify and quantify specific bacteriophage and their hosts to enable us to develop mechanistic models of the ecology of viruses in wastewater treatment systems. However, since we have shown that viruses can be related to effluent quality and virus quantification is simple and cheap, practitioners would probably benefit from quantifying viruses now.

AB Microbial communities are shaped by bacteriophages through predation and lysogeny. A better understanding of the interactions between these processes across different types of environments is key to elucidate how phages mediate microbial competition and to design efficient phage therapies. We introduce an individual-based model (eVIVALDI) to investigate the role of environmental structure in the elimination of a population with a combined treatment of antibiotics and virulent phages, and in the invasion of a population of phage-sensitive bacteria by lysogens. We show that structured environments facilitate the emergence of double resistance, to antibiotics and phages, due to limited diffusion of phage particles and increased nutrient availability from dead cells. They also hinder phage amplification, thus decreasing the generation of phage genetic diversity and increasing the unpredictability of phage-bacteria arms-races. We used a machine learning approach to determine the variables most important for the invasion of sensitive populations by lysogens. They revealed that phage-associated traits and environmental structure are the key drivers of the process. Structured environments hinder invasions, and accounting for their existence improves the fit of the model to published in vivo experimental data. Our results underline environmental structure as key to understand in vivo phage-bacteria interactions.

AB Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are ancient enzymes that catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. They are required for virtually all cellular life and are prominent within viral genomes. RNRs share a common ancestor and must generate a protein radical for direct ribonucleotide reduction. The mechanisms by which RNRs produce radicals are diverse and divide RNRs into three major classes and several subclasses. The diversity of radical generation methods means that cellular organisms and viruses typically contain the RNR best-suited to the environmental conditions surrounding DNA replication. However, such diversity has also fostered high rates of RNR misannotation within subject sequence databases. These misannotations have resulted in incorrect translative presumptions of RNR biochemistry and have diminished the utility of this marker gene for ecological studies of viruses. We discovered a misannotation of the RNR gene within the Prochlorococcus phage P-SSP7 genome, which caused a chain of misannotations within commonly observed RNR genes from marine virioplankton communities. These RNRs are found in marine cyanopodo- and cyanosiphoviruses and are currently misannotated as Class II RNRs, which are O-2-independent and require cofactor B-12. In fact, these cyanoviral RNRs are Class I enzymes that are O-2-dependent and may require a di-metal cofactor made of Fe, Mn, or a combination of the two metals. The discovery of an overlooked Class I beta subunit in the P-SSP7 genome, together with phylogenetic analysis of the alpha and beta subunits confirms that the RNR from P-SSP7 is a Class I RNR. Phylogenetic and conserved residue analyses also suggest that the P-SSP7 RNR may constitute a novel Class I subclass. The reannotation of the RNR Glade represented by P-SSP7 means that most lytic cyanophage contain Class I RNRs, while their hosts, B-12-producing Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, contain Class II RNRs. By using a Class I RNR, cyanophage avoid a dependence on host-produced B-12, a more effective strategy for a lytic virus. The discovery of a novel RNR beta subunit within cyanopodoviruses also implies that some unknown viral genes may be familiar cellular genes that are too divergent for homology-based annotation methods to identify.

AB The prevailing paradigm in ecological studies of viruses and their microbial hosts is that the reproductive success of viruses depends on the proliferation of the 'predator', that is, the virus particle. Yet, viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, and the virus genome-the actual unit of selection-can persist and proliferate from one cell generation to the next without lysis or the production of new virus particles. Here, we propose a theoretical framework to quantify the invasion fitness of viruses using an epidemiological cell-centric metric that focuses on the proliferation of viral genomes inside cells instead of virus particles outside cells. This cell-centric metric enables direct comparison of viral strategies characterized by obligate killing of hosts (e.g. via lysis), persistence of viral genomes inside hosts (e.g. via lysogeny), and strategies along a continuum between these extremes (e.g. via chronic infections). As a result, we can identify environmental drivers, life history traits, and key feedbacks that govern variation in viral propagation in nonlinear population models. For example, we identify threshold conditions given relatively low densities of susceptible cells and relatively high growth rates of infected cells in which lysogenic and other chronic strategies have higher potential viral reproduction than lytic strategies. Altogether, the theoretical framework helps unify the ongoing study of eco-evolutionary drivers of viral strategies in natural environments.

AB A viral metagenomic analysis of five surface and two bottom water (878 meters below surface, mbs, and 3,357 mbs) samples from Prydz Bay, was conducted during February-March 2015. The results demonstrated that most of the DNA viruses were dsDNA viruses (79.73-94.06%, except at PBI1, 37.51%). Of these, Caudovirales (Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae) phages were most abundant in surface seawater (67.67-71.99%), while nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) (Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae, and Pandoraviridae accounted for >30% of dsDNA viruses) were most abundant in the bottom water (3,357 mbs). Of the ssDNA viruses, Microviridae was the dominant family in PBI2, PBI3, PBOs, and PBI4b (57.09-87.55%), while Inoviridae (58.16%) was the dominant family in PBI1. Cellulophaga phages (phi38:1 and phi10:1) and Flavobacterium phage 11b, infecting the possible host strains affiliated with the family Flavobacteriaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes, were abundant in surface water dsDNA viromes. The long contig (PBI2_1_C) from the viral metagenomes were most similar to the genome architectures of Cellulophaga phage phi10:1 and Flavobacterium phage 11b from the Arctic Ocean. Comparative analysis showed that the surface viral community of Prydz Bay could be clearly separated from other marine and freshwater environments. The deep sea viral community was similar to the deep sea viral metagenome at A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment Station (ALOHA, at 22 degrees 45'N, 158 degrees 00'W). The multivariable analysis indicated that nutrients probably played an important role in shaping the local viral community structure. This study revealed the preliminary characteristics of the viral community in Prydz Bay, from both the surface and the deep sea. It provided evidence of the relationships between the virome and the environment in Prydz Bay and provided the first data from the deep sea viral community of the Southern Ocean.

AB Vibrio cholerae is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems. Some strains of V. cholerae can colonize human hosts and cause cholera, a profuse watery diarrhea. The major pathogenicity factors and virulence regulators of V. cholerae are encoded either in mobile genetic elements acquired in the environment (e.g., pathogenicity islands or lysogenic phages) or in the core genome. Several lines of evidence indicate that the emergence of numerous virulence traits of V. cholerae occurred in its natural environment, due to biotic and abiotic pressures. Here, we discuss the connections between the human host and the potential ecological roles of these virulence traits. Elucidating these connections will help us understand the emergence of this organism and other facultative bacterial pathogens.

AB The transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment is a threat to both human and animal health. However, the contribution of bacteriophages to the dissemination of resistance genes via transduction is rarely explored. In this study, we screened pig feces from three commercial farms in China for 32 clinically relevant ARC types to assess the presence of the ARG population in bacteria and bacteriophage and further to estimate the contribution of bacteriophages to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. We found that bacteriophage DNA contained 35.5% of the target ARG types and soil, bla(TEM) and ermB were found in 100% of the phage DNA samples. The most abundant genes in the bacterial population were ermB and fexA whereas ermB was the most abundant in bacteriophage. In contrast, floR was the least abundant ARG in both populations. Also, the ratio index of the abundance of ARGs in bacteriophage and bacteria was firstly used in this study as an estimator of bacteriophage ability to transmit ARGs. The ratio for qnrA was the greatest (about 10(-1)) and differed from the most abundant bacteriophage ARG ermB. In addition, fexA had the lowest ratio value (about 10(-6)) and not floR. These results illustrate that ARGs abundance and detection rates used alone probably be not suitable for comprehensively judging the contribution of bacteriophage to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. A more suitable model is the application of three indices; occurrence rate, absolute abundance in bacteriophage and the ratio value as warning and monitoring tools for environmental ARG assessments in bacteriophages.

AB Despite the abundance, ubiquity and impact of environmental viruses, their inherent genomic plasticity and extreme diversity pose significant challenges for the examination of bacteriophages on Earth. Viral metagenomic studies have offered insight into broader aspects of phage ecology and repeatedly uncover genes to which we are currently unable to assign function. A combined effort of phage isolation and metagenomic survey of Chicago's nearshore waters of Lake Michigan revealed the presence of Pbunaviruses, relatives of the Pseudomonas phage PB1. This prompted our expansive investigation of PB1-like phages. Genomic signatures of PB1-like phages and Pbunaviruses were identified, permitting the unambiguous distinction between the presence/absence of these phages in soils, freshwater and wastewater samples, as well as publicly available viral metagenomic datasets. This bioinformatic analysis led to the de novo assembly of nine novel PB1-like phage genomes from a metagenomic survey of samples collected from Lake Michigan. While this study finds that Pbunaviruses are abundant in various environments of Northern Illinois, genomic variation also exists to a considerable extent within individual communities.

AB Bacteriophages play significant role in driving microbial diversity; however, little is known about the diversity of phages in different ecosystems. A dynamic predator-prey mechanism called "kill the winner" suggests the elimination of most active bacterial populations through phages. Thus, interaction between phage and host has an effect on the composition of microbial communities in ecosystems. In this study, secondary phage metagenome data from aquatic habitats: wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), fresh, marine, and hot water spring habitat were analyzed using MG-RAST and STAMP tools to explore the diversity of the viruses. Differential relative abundance of phage families-Siphoviridae (34%) and Myoviridae (26%) in WWTP, Myoviridae (30%) and Podoviridae (23%) in fresh water, and Myoviridae (41%) and Podoviridae (8%) in marine-was found to be a discriminating factor among four habitats while Rudiviridae (9%), Globuloviridae (8%), and Lipothrixviridae (1%) were exclusively observed in hot water spring. Subsequently, at genera level, Bpp-1-like virus, Chlorovirus, and T4-like virus were found abundant in WWTP, fresh, and marine habitat, respectively. PCA analysis revealed completely disparate composition of phage in hot water spring from other three ecosystems. Similar analysis of relative abundance of functional features corroborated observations from taxa analysis. Functional features corresponding to phage packaging machinery, replication, integration and excision, and gene transfer discriminated among four habitats. The comparative metagenomics approach exhibited genetically distinct phage communities among four habitats. Results revealed that selective distribution of phage communities would help in understanding the role of phages in food chains, nutrient cycling, and microbial ecology. Study of specific phages would also help in controlling environmental pathogens including MDR bacterial populations using phage therapy approach by selective mining and isolation of phages against specific pathogens persisting in a given environment.

TI Investigation of prevalence of free Shiga toxinproducing Escherichia
   coli (STEC)-specific bacteriophages and its correlation with STEC
   bacterial hosts in a produce-growing area in Salinas, California

AB Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) causes approximately 265,000 illnesses and 3,600 hospitalizations annually and is highly associated with animal contamination due to the natural reservoir of ruminant gastrointestinal tracts. Free STEC-specific bacteriophages against STEC strains are also commonly isolated from fecal-contaminated environment. Previous studies have evaluated the correlation between the prevalence of STEC-specific bacteriophages and STEC strains to improve animal-associated environment. However, the similar information regarding free STEC-specific bacteriophages prevalence in produce growing area is lacking. Thus, the objectives of this research were to determine the prevalence of STEC-specific phages, analyze potential effects of environmental factors on the prevalence of the phages, and study correlations between STEC-specific bacteriophages and the bacterial hosts in pre-harvest produce environment. Surface water from 20 samples sites was subjected to free bacteriophage isolation using host strains of both generic E. coli and STEC (O157, six non-O157 and one O179 strains) cocktails, and isolation of O157 and non-O157 STEC strains by use of culture methods combined with PCR-based confirmation. The weather data were obtained from weather station website. Free O145-and O179-specific bacteriophages were the two most frequently isolated bacteriophages among all (O45, O145, O157 and O179) in this study. The results showed June and July had relatively high prevalence of overall STEC-specific bacteriophages with minimum isolation of STEC strains. In addition, the bacteriophages were likely isolated in the area D around or within city D with predominant human impact, whereas the STEC bacterial isolates were commonly found in agriculture impact environment. Furthermore, there was a trend that the sample sites with positive of free STEC bacteriophage did not have the specific STEC bacterial hosts. The findings of the study enable us to understand the ecology between free STEC-specific phages and STEC bacteria for further pre-harvest food safety management in produce environment.

AB Cholera epidemics have been recorded periodically in Vietnam during the seventh cholera pandemic. Since cholera is a water-borne disease, systematic monitoring of environmental waters for Vibrio cholerae presence is important for predicting and preventing cholera epidemics. We conducted monitoring, isolation, and genetic characterization of V. cholerae strains in Nam Dinh province of Northern Vietnam from Jul 2013 to Feb 2015. In this study, four V. cholerae O1 strains were detected and isolated from 110 analyzed water samples (3.6%); however, none of them carried the cholera toxin gene, ctxA, in their genomes. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four O1 isolates were separated into two independent clusters, and one of them diverged from a common ancestor with pandemic strains. The analysis of pathogenicity islands (CTX prophage, VPI-I, VPI-II, VSP-I, and VSP-II) indicated that one strain (VNND_2014Jun_6SS) harbored an unknown prophage-like sequence with high homology to vibriophage KSF-1 phi and VCY phi, identified from Bangladesh and the USA, respectively, while the other three strains carried tcpA gene with a distinct sequence demonstrating a separate clonal lineage. These results suggest that the aquatic environment can harbor highly divergent V. cholera strains and serve as a reservoir for multiple V. cholerae virulence-associated genes which may be exchanged via mobile genetic elements. Therefore, continuous monitoring and genetic characterization of V. cholerae strains in the environment should contribute to the early detection of the sources of infection and prevention of cholera outbreaks as well as to understanding the natural ecology and evolution of V. cholerae.

AB The Amazon River watershed and its associated plume comprise a vast continental and oceanic area. The microbial activities along this continuum contribute substantially to global carbon and nutrient cycling, and yet there is a dearth of information on the diversity, abundance, and possible roles of viruses in this globally important river. The aim of this study was to elucidate the diversity and structure of virus assemblages of the Amazon River-ocean continuum. Environmental viral DNA sequences were obtained for 12 locations along the river's lower reach (n = 5) and plume (n = 7). Sequence assembly yielded 29,358 scaffolds, encoding 82,546 viral proteins, with 15 new complete viral genomes. Despite the spatial connectivity mediated by the river, virome analyses and physical-chemical water parameters clearly distinguished river and plume ecosystems. Bacteriophages were ubiquitous in the continuum and were more abundant in the transition region. Eukaryotic viruses occurred mostly in the river, while the plume had more viruses of autotrophic organisms (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus) and heterotrophic bacteria (Pelagibacter). The viral families Microviridae and Myoviridae were the most abundant and occurred throughout the continuum. The major functions of the genes in the continuum involved viral structures and life cycles, and viruses from plume locations and Tapajos River showed the highest levels of functional diversity. The distribution patterns of the viral assemblages were defined not only by the occurrence of possible hosts but also by water physical and chemical parameters, especially salinity. The findings presented here help to improve understanding of the possible roles of viruses in the organic matter cycle along the river-ocean continuum.
   IMPORTANCE The Amazon River forms a vast plume in the Atlantic Ocean that can extend for more than 1,000 km. Microbial communities promote a globally relevant carbon sink system in the plume. Despite the importance of viruses for the global carbon cycle, the diversity and the possible roles of viruses in the Amazon are poorly understood. The present work assesses, for the first time, the abundance and diversity of viruses simultaneously in the river and ocean in order to elucidate their possible roles. DNA sequence assembly yielded 29,358 scaffolds, encoding 82,546 viral proteins, with 15 new complete viral genomes from the 12 river and ocean locations. Viral diversity was clearly distinguished by river and ocean. Bacteriophages were the most abundant and occurred throughout the continuum. Viruses that infect eukaryotes were more abundant in the river, whereas phages appeared to have strong control over the host prokaryotic populations in the plume.

AB Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen commonly found in environments of seafood processing, thus presenting a challenge for eradication from seafood processing facilities. Monitoring the prevalence and subtype diversity of L. monocytogenes together with phages that are specific to Listeria spp. ("Listeria phages") will provide knowledge on the bacteria-phage ecology in food processing plants. In this work, a total of 595 samples were collected from raw material, finished seafood products and environmental samples from different sites of a seafood processing plant during 17 sampling visits in 1.5 years of study. L monocytogenes and Listeria spp. (non-monocytogenes) were found in 22 (3.7%) and 43 (7.2%) samples, respectively, whereas 29 Listeria phages were isolated from 9 (1.5%) phage-positive samples. DNA fingerprint analysis of L. monocytogenes isolates revealed 11 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles, with two subtypes were frequently observed over time. Our data reveal a presence of Listeria phages within the same seafood processing environments where a diverse set of L monocytogenes subtypes was also found. Although serotype 4b was observed at lower frequency, data indicate that isolates from this seafood processing plant belonged to both epidemiologically important serotypes 1/2a and 4b, which may suggest a potential public health risk. Phages (all showed a unique genome size of 65 +/- 2 kb) were classified into 9 host range groups, representing both broad- and narrow-host range. While most L monocytogenes isolates from this facility were susceptible to phages, five isolates showed resistance to 12-20 phages. Variations in phage host range among Listeria phages isolated from food processing plant may affect a presence of a diverse set of L. monocytogenes isolates derived from the same processing environment in Thailand.

AB Bacteriophages are ubiquitous and affect most facets of life, from evolution of bacteria, through ecology and global biochemical cycling to human health. The interactions between phages and bacteria often lead to biological novelty and an important milestone in this process is the ability of phages to regulate their host's behavior. In this review article, we will focus on newly reported cases that demonstrate how temperate phages regulate bacterial gene expression and behavior in a variety of bacterial species, pathogenic and environmental. This regulation is mediated by diverse mechanisms such as transcription factors, sRNAs, DNA rearrangements, and even controlled bacterial lysis. The outcome is mutualistic relationships that enable adaptively enhanced communal phage-host fitness under specific conditions.

AB Temperate bacterial viruses (phages) may enter a symbiosis with their host cell, forming a unit called a lysogen. Infection and viral replication are disassociated in lysogens until an induction event such as DNA damage occurs, triggering viral-mediated lysis. The lysogen-lytic viral reproduction switch is central to viral ecology, with diverse ecosystem impacts. It has been argued that lysogeny is favoured in phages at low host densities. This paradigm is based on the fraction of chemically inducible cells (FCIC) lysogeny proxy determined using DNA-damaging mitomycin C inductions. Contrary to the established paradigm, a survey of 39 inductions publications found FCIC to be highly variable and pervasively insensitive to bacterial host density at global, within-environment and within-study levels. Attempts to determine the source(s) of variability highlighted the inherent complications in using the FCIC proxy in mixed communities, including dissociation between rates of lysogeny and FCIC values. Ultimately, FCIC studies do not provide robust measures of lysogeny or consistent evidence of either positive or negative host density dependence to the lytic-lysogenic switch. Other metrics are therefore needed to understand the drivers of the lytic-lysogenic decision in viral communities and to test models of the host density-dependent viral lytic-lysogenic switch.

AB The Roseobacter clade is abundant and widespread in marine environments and plays an important role in oceanic biogeochemical cycling. In this present study, a lytic siphophage (labeled vB_DshS-R5C) infecting the strain type of Dinoroseobacter shibae named DFL12(T), which is part of the Roseobacter clade, was isolated from the oligotrophic South China Sea. Phage R5C showed a narrow host range, short latent period and low burst size. The genome length of phage R5C was 77, 874 bp with a G+C content of 61.5%. Genomic comparisons detected no genome matches in the GenBank database and phylogenetic analysis based on DNA polymerase I revealed phylogenetic features that were distinct to other phages, suggesting the novelty of R5C. Several auxiliary metabolic genes (e.g., phoH gene, heat shock protein and queuosine biosynthesis genes) were identified in the R5C genome that may be beneficial to the host and/or offer a competitive advantage for the phage. Among siphophages infecting the Roseobacter clade (roseosiphophages), four gene transfer agent- like genes were commonly located with close proximity to structural genes, suggesting that their function may be related to the tail of siphoviruses. The isolation and characterization of R5C demonstrated the high genomic and physiological diversity of roseophages as well as improved our understanding of host-phage interactions and the ecology of the marine Roseobacter.

AB In communities with bacterial viruses (phage) and bacteria, the phage-bacteria infection network establishes which virus types infect which host types. The structure of the infection network is a key element in understanding community dynamics. Yet, this infection network is often difficult to ascertain. Introduced over 60 years ago, the plaque assay remains the gold standard for establishing who infects whom in a community. This culture-based approach does not scale to environmental samples with increased levels of phage and bacterial diversity, much of which is currently unculturable. Here, we propose an alternative method of inferring phage-bacteria infection networks. This method uses time-series data of fluctuating population densities to estimate the complete interaction network without having to test each phage-bacteria pair individually. We use in silico experiments to analyse the factors affecting the quality of network reconstruction and find robust regimes where accurate reconstructions are possible. In addition, we present a multi-experiment approach where time series from different experiments are combined to improve estimates of the infection network. This approach also mitigates against the possibility of evolutionary changes to relevant phenotypes during the time course of measurement.

AB When using bacteriophages to control food-borne bacteria in food production plants and processed food, it is crucial to consider that environmental conditions influence their stability. These conditions can also affect the physiological state of bacteria and consequently hostvirus interaction and the effectiveness of the phage ability to reduce bacteria numbers. In this study we investigated the stability, binding, and replication capability of phage P100 and its efficacy to control Listeria monocytogenes under conditions typically encountered in dairy plants. The influences of SDS, Lutensol AO 7, salt, smear water, and different temperatures were investigated. Results indicate that phage P100 is stable and able to bind to the host under most conditions tested. Replication was dependent upon the growth of L. monocytogenes and efficacy was higher when bacterial growth was reduced by certain environmental conditions. In long-term experiments at different temperatures phages were initially able to reduce bacteria up to seven log10 units after 2 weeks at 4 degrees C. However, thereafter, re-growth and development of phage-resistant L. monocytogenes isolates were encountered

AB Marine viruses often contain host-derived metabolic genes (i.e., auxiliary metabolic genes; AMGs), which are hypothesized to increase viral replication by augmenting key steps in host metabolism. Currently described AMGs encompass a wide variety of metabolic functions, including amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, energy production, and iron-sulfur cluster assembly and modification, and their community-wide gene content and abundance vary as a function of environmental conditions. Here, we describe different AMGs classes, their hypothesized role in redirecting host carbon metabolism, and their ecological importance. Focusing on metagenomic ocean surveys, we propose a new model where a suite of phage-encoded genes activate host pathways that respond rapidly to environmental cues, presumably resulting in rapid changes to host metabolic flux for phage production.

AB The biological carbon pump is the process by which CO2 is transformed to organic carbon via photosynthesis, exported through sinking particles, and finally sequestered in the deep ocean. While the intensity of the pump correlates with plankton community composition, the underlying ecosystem structure driving the process remains largely uncharacterized. Here we use environmental and metagenomic data gathered during the Tara Oceans expedition to improve our understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. We show that specific plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate with carbon export at 150 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted, oligotrophic ocean. Additionally, we show that the relative abundance of a few bacterial and viral genes can predict a significant fraction of the variability in carbon export in these regions.

AB Heterogeneity in rates of survival, growth and reproduction among viruses is related to virus particle (i.e. virion) size, but we have little understanding of the factors that govern the four to five orders of magnitude in virus size variation. Here, we analyse variation in virion size in 67 double-stranded DNA viruses (i.e. dsDNA) that span all major biomes, and infect organisms ranging from single-celled prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes. We find that two metrics of virion size (i.e. virion volume and genome length) decrease by about 55-fold as the temperature of occurrence increases from 0 to 40 degrees C. We also find that gene overlap increases exponentially with temperature, such that smaller viruses have proportionally greater gene overlap at higher temperatures. These results indicate dsDNA virus size increases with environmental temperature in much the same way as the cell or genome size of many host species.

AB Metagenomics has changed the face of virus discovery by enabling the accurate identification of viral genome sequences without requiring isolation of the viruses. As a result, metagenomic virus discovery leaves the first and most fundamental question about any novel virus unanswered: What host does the virus infect? The diversity of the global virosphere and the volumes of data obtained in metagenomic sequencing projects demand computational tools for virus-host prediction. We focus on bacteriophages (phages, viruses that infect bacteria), the most abundant and diverse group of viruses found in environmental metagenomes. By analyzing 820 phages with annotated hosts, we review and assess the predictive power of in silico phage-host signals. Sequence homology approaches are the most effective at identifying known phage-host pairs. Compositional and abundance-based methods contain significant signal for phage-host classification, providing opportunities for analyzing the unknowns in viral metagenomes. Together, these computational approaches further our knowledge of the interactions between phages and their hosts. Importantly, we find that all reviewed signals significantly link phages to their hosts, illustrating how current knowledge and insights about the interaction mechanisms and ecology of coevolving phages and bacteria can be exploited to predict phage-host relationships, with potential relevance for medical and industrial applications.New viruses infecting bacteria are increasingly being discovered in many environments through sequence-based explorations. To understand their role in microbial ecosystems, computational tools are indispensable to prioritize and guide experimental efforts. This review assesses and discusses a range of bioinformatic approaches to predict bacteriophage-host relationships when all that is known is their genome sequence.New viruses infecting bacteria are increasingly being discovered in many environments through sequence-based explorations.

AB In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the field of virus environmental ecology. In marine ecosystems, for example, viruses are now thought to play pivotal roles in the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and to be mediators of microbial evolution through horizontal gene transfer. The diversity and ecology of viruses in soils are poorly understood, but evidence supports the view that the diversity and ecology of viruses in soils differ substantially from those in aquatic systems. Desert biomes cover similar to 33% of global land masses, and yet the diversity and roles of viruses in these dominant ecosystems remain poorly understood. There is evidence that hot hyperarid desert soils are characterized by high levels of bacterial lysogens and low extracellular virus counts. In contrast, cold desert soils contain high extracellular virus titers. We suggest that the prevalence of microbial biofilms in hyperarid soils, combined with extreme thermal regimens, exerts strong selection pressures on both temperate and virulent viruses. Many desert soil virus sequences show low values of identity to virus genomes in public databases, suggesting the existence of distinct and as-yet-uncharacterized soil phylogenetic lineages (e.g., cyanophages). We strongly advocate for amplification-free metavirome analyses while encouraging the classical isolation of phages from dominant and culturable microbial isolates in order to populate sequence databases. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the study of viruses in hyperarid soils and of the factors that contribute to viral abundance and diversity in hot and cold deserts and offers technical recommendations for future studies.

AB Stormwater retention ponds are ubiquitous in urban and suburban landscapes of the United States. Most studies of the microbiology of these ponds have focused on the abundance and removal efficiency of fecal indicator bacteria. Here we provide the first comprehensive study of microbial community diversity and activity in these ponds, and assess how different environmental and engineering factors influence these communities. Watershed land-use had no grouping effect on pond geochemistry or biology. Instead, we found that microbial community composition and activity were best explained by site-specific environmental variables. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that bacterial community structure varied greatly across sampled ponds, and appeared to be the result of autochthonous bacterial growth and not simply surface runoff. Metagenomic sequencing of pond viral communities suggested that viral taxa were influenced by external inputs, with viromes composed of bacteriophage that infect environmental bacteria, as well as viruses that infect eukaryotes and phages that infect bacteria pathogenic to eukaryotes. Collectively, our results indicate that the environmental conditions and microbial communities of these ponds vary greatly, even among ponds in close spatial proximity, and that pond microbial communities appear to be shaped by site-specific environmental factors.

AB Select bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or coliforms, have been widely used as sentinels of low water quality; however, there are concerns regarding their predictive accuracy for the protection of human and environmental health. To develop improved monitoring systems, a greater understanding of bacterial community structure, function, and variability across time is required in the context of different pollution types, such as agricultural and urban contamination. Here, we present a year long survey of free-living bacterial DNA collected from seven sites along rivers in three watersheds with varying land use in Southwestern Canada. This is the first study to examine the bacterial metagenome in flowing freshwater (lotic) environments over such a time span, providing an opportunity to describe bacterial community variability as a function of land use and environmental conditions. Characteristics of the metagenomic data, such as sequence composition and average genome size (AGS), vary with sampling site, environmental conditions, and water chemistry. For example, AGS was correlated with hours of daylight in the agricultural watershed and, across the agriculturally and urban-affected sites, k-mer composition clustering corresponded to nutrient concentrations. In addition to indicating a community shift, this change in AGS has implications in terms of the normalization strategies required, and considerations surrounding such strategies in general are discussed. When comparing abundances of gene functional groups between high- and low-quality water samples collected from an agricultural area, the latter had a higher abundance of nutrient metabolism and bacteriophage groups, possibly reflecting an increase in agricultural runoff. This work presents a valuable dataset representing a year of monthly sampling across watersheds and an analysis targeted at establishing a foundational understanding of how bacterial lotic communities vary across time and land use. The results provide important context for future studies, including further analyses of watershed ecosystem health, and the identification and development of biomarkers for improved water quality monitoring systems.

AB Antarctic ecosystems are dominated by micro-organisms, and viruses play particularly important roles in the food webs. Since the first report in 2009 (Lopez-Bueno etal. ), omic'-based studies have greatly enlightened our understanding of Antarctic aquatic microbial diversity and ecosystem function (Wilkins etal. ; Cavicchioli ). This has included the discovery of many new eukaryotic viruses (Lopez-Bueno etal. ), virophage predators of algal viruses (Yau etal. ), bacteria with resistance to phage (Lauro etal. ) and mechanisms of haloarchaeal evasion, defence and adaptation to viruses (Tschitschko etal. ). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Lopez-Bueno etal. () report the first discovery of RNA viruses from an Antarctic aquatic environment. High sequence coverage enabled genome variation to be assessed for four positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses from the order Picornavirales. By examining the populations present in the water column and in the lake's catchment area, populations of quasispecies' were able to be linked to local environmental factors. In view of the importance of viruses in Antarctic ecosystems but lack of data describing them, this study represents a significant advance in the field.

AB Bacteriophages are the viruses of bacteria. In the guise of phage therapy they have been used for decades to successfully treat what are probable biofilm-containing chronic bacterial infections. More recently, phage treatment or biocontrol of biofilm bacteria has been brought back to the laboratory for more rigorous assessment as well as towards the use of phages to combat environmental biofilms, ones other than those directly associated with bacterial infections. Considered in a companion article is the inherent ecological utility of bacteriophages versus antibiotics as anti-biofilm agents. Discussed here is a model for phage ecological interaction with bacteria as they may occur across biofilm-containing ecosystems. Specifically, to the extent that individual bacterial types are not highly abundant within biofilm-containing environments, then phage exploitation of those bacteria may represent a "Feast-or-famine" existence in which infection of highly localized concentrations of phage-sensitive bacteria alternate with treacherous searches by the resulting phage progeny virions for new concentrations of phage-sensitive bacteria to infect. An updated synopsis of the literature concerning laboratory testing of phage use to combat bacterial biofilms is then provided along with tips on how "Ecologically" such phage-mediated biofilm control can be modified to more reliably achieve anti-biofilm efficacy.

AB Winogradsky columns are model microbial ecosystems prepared by adding pond sediment to a clear cylinder with additional supplements and incubated with light. Environmental gradients develop within the column creating diverse niches that allow enrichment of specific bacteria. The enrichment culture can be used to study soil and sediment microbial community structure and function. In this study we used a 16S rRNA gene survey to characterize the microbial community dynamics during Winogradsky column development to determine the rate and extent of change from the source sediment community. Over a period of 60 days, the microbial community changed from the founding pond sediment population: Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, and Planctomycetes increased in relative abundance over time, while most Proteobacteria decreased in relative abundance. A unique, lightdependent surface biofilm community formed by 60 days that was less diverse and dominated by a few highly abundant bacteria. 67-72% of the surface community was comprised of highly enriched taxa that were rare in the source pond sediment, including the Cyanobacteria Anabaena, a member of the Gemmatimonadetes phylum, and a member of the Chloroflexi class Anaerolinea. This indicates that rare taxa can become abundant under appropriate environmental conditions and supports the hypothesis that rare taxa serve as a microbial seed bank. We also present preliminary findings that suggest that bacteriophages may be active in the Winogradsky community. The dynamics of certain taxa, most notably the Cyanobacteria, showed a bloom-and-decline pattern, consistent with bacteriophage predation as predicted in the kill-the-winner hypothesis. Time-lapse photography also supported the possibility of bacteriophage activity, revealing a pattern of colony clearance similar to formation of viral plaques. The Winogradsky column, a technique developed early in the history of microbial ecology to enrich soil microbes, may therefore be a useful model system to investigate both microbial and viral ecology.

AB Phages are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and play major ecological roles, yet the current sequenced phage genomes do not adequately represent their diversity, and little is known about the abundance and distribution of these sequenced genomes in nature. Although the study of phage ecology has benefited tremendously from the emergence of metagenomic sequencing, a systematic survey of phage genes and genomes in various ecosystems is still lacking, and fundamental questions about phage biology, lifestyle, and ecology remain unanswered. To address these questions and improve comparative analysis of phages in different metagenomes, we screened a core set of publicly available metagenomic samples for sequences related to completely sequenced phages using the web tool, Phage Eco-Locator. We then adopted and deployed an array of mathematical and statistical metrics for a multidimensional estimation of the abundance and distribution of phage genes and genomes in various ecosystems. Experiments using those metrics individually showed their usefulness in emphasizing the pervasive, yet uneven, distribution of known phage sequences in environmental metagenomes. Using these metrics in combination allowed us to resolve phage genomes into clusters that correlated with their genotypes and taxonomic classes as well as their ecological properties. We propose adding this set of metrics to current metaviromic analysis pipelines, where they can provide insight regarding phage mosaicism, habitat specificity, and evolution.

AB Antibiotics leak constantly into environments due to widespread use in agriculture and human therapy. Although sublethal concentrations are well known to select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, little is known about how bacterial evolution cascades through food webs, having indirect effect on species not directly affected by antibiotics (e.g. via population dynamics or pleiotropic effects). Here, we used an experimental evolution approach to test how temporal patterns of antibiotic stress, as well as migration within meta-populations, affect the evolution and ecology of microcosms containing one prey bacterium, one phage and two protist predators. We found that environmental variability, autocorrelation and migration had only subtle effects for population and evolutionary dynamics. However, unexpectedly, bacteria evolved greatest fitness increases to both antibiotics and enemies when the sublethal levels of antibiotics were highest, indicating positive pleiotropy. Crucially, bacterial adaptation cascaded through the food web leading to reduced predator-to-prey abundance ratio, lowered predator community diversity and increased instability of populations. Our results show that the presence of natural enemies can modify and even reverse the effects of antibiotics on bacteria, and that antibiotic selection can change the ecological properties of multitrophic microbial communities by having indirect effects on species not directly affected by antibiotics.

AB Viral metagenomics (viromics) is a tremendous tool to reveal viral taxonomic and functional diversity across ecosystems ranging from the human gut to the world's oceans. As with microbes however, there appear vast swaths of "dark matter" yet to be documented for viruses, even among relatively well studied viral types. Here, we use viromics to explore the "Far-T4 phages" sequence space, a neighbor clade from the well-studied T4-like phages that was first detected through PCR study in seawater and subsequently identified in freshwater lakes through 454-sequenced viromes. To advance the description of these viruses beyond this single marker gene, we explore Far-T4 genome fragments assembled from two deeply-sequenced freshwater viromes. Single gene phylogenetic trees confirm that the Far-T4 phages are divergent from the T4-like phages, genome fragments reveal largely collinear genome organizations, and both data led to the delineation of five Far 14 clades. Three-dimensional models of major capsid proteins are consistent with a 14-like structure, and highlight a highly conserved core flanked by variable insertions. Finally, we contextualize these now better characterized Far-T4 phages by re-analyzing 196 previously published viromes. These suggest that Far-T4 are common in freshwater and seawater as only four of 82 aquatic viromes lacked Far-T4-like sequences. Variability in representation across the five newly identified clades suggests clade-specific niche differentiation may be occurring across the different biomes, though the underlying mechanism remains unidentified. While complete genome assembly from complex communities and the lack of host linkage information still bottleneck virus discovery through viromes, these findings exemplify the power of metagenomics approaches to assess the diversity, evolutionary history, and genomic characteristics of novel uncultivated phages.

AB The discovery of abundant viruses in the oceans and on land has ushered in a quarter century of groundbreaking advancements in our understanding of viruses within ecosystems. Two types of observations from environmental samples direct counts of viral particles and viral metagenomic sequences - have been critical to these discoveries. Accurate direct counts have established ecosystem-scale trends in the impacts of viral infection on microbial host populations and have shown that viral communities within aquatic and soil environments respond to both short term and seasonal environmental change. Direct counts have been critical for estimating viral production rate, a measurement essential to quantifying the implications of viral infection for the bio-geochemical cycling of nutrients within ecosystems. While direct counts have defined the magnitude of viral processes; shotgun sequences of environmental viral DNA - virome sequences - have enabled researchers to estimate the diversity and composition of natural viral communities. Virome-enabled studies have found the virioplankton to contain thousands of viral genotypes in communities where the most dominant viral population accounts for a small fraction of total abundance followed by a long tail of diverse populations. Detailed examination of long virome sequences has led to new understanding of genotype-to-phenotype connections within marine viruses and revealed that viruses carry metabolic genes that are important to maintaining cellular energy during viral replication. Increased access to long virome sequences will undoubtedly reveal more genetic secrets of viruses and enable us to build a genomics rulebook for predicting key biological and ecological features of unknown viruses.

AB This paper reviews the problem of foaming associated with the activated sludge process and its control using various physical, chemical and biological methods. Activated sludge process is widely used for treatment of every type of wastewater like industrial, domestic and municipal wastewater. This process is driven by a complex microbial population, among which some mycolic acid containing bacteria leads to the stable foam formation which ultimately results in poor efficiency of the plants and leading to major environmental, operational, and health problems. A number of researches provide the evidences of foaming in wastewater treatment plants and its control using physical, chemical and biological methods. Current approaches for controlling foam includes operational adjustments, additional structures, controlling dissolved oxygen levels, water sprays, steam application, polymer addition, chlorination and a novel and ecofriendly approach that is treatment of filamentous bacteria with the specific phages. A detailed study of all methods is presented and collectively described in this review paper for a better understanding of the foam controlling strategies.

AB Background: Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems confer resistance to viral infection and thus mediate bacteria-phage interactions. However, the distribution and functional diversity of CRISPRs among environmental bacteria remains largely unknown. Here, comparative genomics of 75 Salinispora strains provided insight into the diversity and distribution of CRISPR-Cas systems in a cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus.
   Results: CRISPRs were found in all Salinispora strains, with the majority containing multiple loci and different Cas array subtypes. Of the six subtypes identified, three have not been previously described. A lower prophage frequency in S. arenicola was associated with a higher fraction of spacers matching Salinispora prophages compared to S. tropica, suggesting differing defensive capacities between Salinispora species. The occurrence of related prophages in strains from distant locations, as well as spacers matching those prophages inserted throughout spacer arrays, indicate recurring encounters with widely distributed phages over time. Linkages of CRISPR features with Salinispora microdiversity pointed to subclade-specific contacts with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This included lineage-specific spacer deletions or insertions, which may reflect weak selective pressures to maintain immunity or distinct temporal interactions with MGEs, respectively. Biogeographic patterns in spacer and prophage distributions support the concept that Salinispora spp. encounter localized MGEs. Moreover, the presence of spacers matching housekeeping genes suggests that CRISPRs may have functions outside of viral defense.
   Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive examination of CRISPR-Cas systems in a broadly distributed group of environmental bacteria. The ubiquity and diversity of CRISPRs in Salinispora suggests that CRISPR-mediated interactions with MGEs represent a major force in the ecology and evolution of this cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus.

AB Members of the enterobacterial genus Serratia are ecologically widespread, and some strains are opportunistic human pathogens. Bacteriophage phi MAM1 was isolated on Serratia plymuthica A153, a biocontrol rhizosphere strain that produces the potently bioactive antifungal and anticancer haterumalide oocydin A. The phi MAM1 phage is a generalized transducing phage that infects multiple environmental and clinical isolates of Serratia spp. and a rhizosphere strain of Kluyvera cryocrescens. Electron microscopy allowed classification of phi MAM1 in the family Myoviridae. Bacteriophage phi MAM1 is virulent, uses capsular polysaccharides as a receptor, and can transduce chromosomal markers at frequencies of up to 7 x 10(-6) transductants per PFU. We also demonstrated transduction of the complete 77-kb oocydin A gene cluster and heterogeneric transduction of a plasmid carrying a type III toxin-antitoxin system. These results support the notion of the potential ecological importance of transducing phages in the acquisition of genes by horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenetic analyses grouped phi MAM1 within the ViI-like bacteriophages, and genomic analyses revealed that the major differences between phi MAM1 and other ViI-like phages arise in a region encoding the host recognition determinants. Our results predict that the wider genus of ViI-like phages could be efficient transducing phages, and this possibility has obvious implications for the ecology of horizontal gene transfer, bacterial functional genomics, and synthetic biology.

AB Microbes and their viruses drive myriad processes across ecosystems ranging from oceans and soils to bioreactors and humans(1-4). Despite this importance, microbial diversity is only now being mapped at scales relevant to nature(5), while the viral diversity associated with any particular host remains little researched. Here we quantify host-associated viral diversity using viral-tagged metagenomics, which links viruses to specific host cells for high-throughput screening and sequencing. In a single experiment, we screened 10(7) Pacific Ocean viruses against a single strain of Synechococcus and found that naturally occurring cyanophage genome sequence space is statistically clustered into discrete populations. These population-based, host-linked viral ecological data suggest that, for this single host and seawater sample alone, there are at least 26 double-stranded DNA viral populations with estimated relative abundances ranging from 0.06 to 18.2%. These populations include previously cultivated cyanophage and new viral types missed by decades of isolate-based studies. Nucleotide identities of homologous genes mostly varied by less than 1% within populations, even in hypervariable genome regions, and by 42-71% between populations, which provides benchmarks for viral metagenomics and genome-based viral species definitions. Together these findings showcase a new approach to viral ecology that quantitatively links objectively defined environmental viral populations, and their genomes, to their hosts.

AB The coincidental theory of virulence predicts that bacterial pathogenicity could be a by-product of selection by natural enemies in environmental reservoirs. However, current results are ambiguous and the simultaneous impact of multiple ubiquitous enemies, protists and phages on virulence evolution has not been investigated previously. Here we tested experimentally how Tetrahymena thermophila protist predation and PNM phage parasitism (bacteria-specific virus) alone and together affect the evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 virulence, measured in wax moth larvae. Protist predation selected for small colony types, both in the absence and presence of phage, which showed decreased edibility to protists, reduced growth in the absence of enemies and attenuated virulence. Although phage selection alone did not affect the bacterial phenotype, it weakened protist-driven antipredatory defence (biofilm formation), its associated pleiotropic growth cost and the correlated reduction in virulence. These results suggest that protist selection can be a strong coincidental driver of attenuated bacterial virulence, and that phages can constrain this effect owing to effects on population dynamics and conflicting selection pressures. Attempting to define causal links such as these might help us to predict the cold and hot spots of coincidental virulence evolution on the basis of microbial community composition of environmental reservoirs.

AB Viruses (including bacteriophages) are the most abundant biological entities on the planet. As such, they are thought to have a major impact on all aspects of microbial community structure and function. Despite this critical role in ecosystem processes, the study of virus/phage diversity has lagged far behind parallel studies of the bacterial and eukaryotic kingdoms, largely due to the absence of any universal phylogenetic marker. Here we review the development and use of signature genes to investigate viral diversity, as a viable strategy for data sets of specific virus groups. Genes that have been used include those encoding structural proteins, such as portal protein, major capsid protein, and tail sheath protein, auxiliary metabolism genes, such as psbA, psbB, and phoH, and several polymerase genes. These marker genes have been used in combination with PCR-based fingerprinting and/or sequencing strategies to investigate spatial, temporal, and seasonal variations and diversity in a wide range of habitats.

AB Since the discovery 2-3 decades ago that viruses of microbes are abundant in marine ecosystems, viral ecology has grown increasingly to reach the status of a full scientific discipline in environmental sciences. A dedicated ISVM society, the International Society for Viruses of Microorganisms, (http://www.isvm.org/) was recently launched. Increasing studies in viral ecology are sources of novel knowledge related to the biodiversity of living things, the functioning of ecosystems, and the evolution of the cellular world. This is because viruses are perhaps the most diverse, abundant, and ubiquitous biological entities in the biosphere, although local environmental conditions enrich for certain viral types through selective pressure. They exhibit various lifestyles that intimately depend on the deep-cellular mechanisms, and are ultimately replicated by members of all three domains of cellular life (Bacteria, Eukarya, Archaea), as well as by giant viruses of some eukaryotic cells. This establishes viral parasites as microbial killers but also as cell partners or metabolic manipulators in microbial ecology. The present chapter sought to review the literature on the diversity and functional roles of viruses of microbes in environmental microbiology, focusing primarily on prokaryotic viruses (i.e., phages) in aquatic ecosystems, which form the bulk of our knowledge in modern environmental viral ecology.

AB Background: Multiple infection sources for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) are known, including animal products, fruit and vegetables. The ecology of this pathogen outside its human host is largely unknown and one third of its annotated genes are still hypothetical. To identify genetic determinants expressed under a variety of environmental factors, we applied strand-specific RNA-sequencing, comparing the SOLiD and Illumina systems.
   Results: Transcriptomes of EHEC were sequenced under 11 different biotic and abiotic conditions: LB medium at pH4, pH7, pH9, or at 15 degrees C; LB with nitrite or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; LB-agar surface, M9 minimal medium, spinach leaf juice, surface of living radish sprouts, and cattle feces. Of 5379 annotated genes in strain EDL933 (genome and plasmid), a surprising minority of only 144 had null sequencing reads under all conditions. We therefore developed a statistical method to distinguish weakly transcribed genes from background transcription. We find that 96% of all genes and 91.5% of the hypothetical genes exhibit a significant transcriptional signal under at least one condition. Comparing SOLiD and Illumina systems, we find a high correlation between both approaches for fold-changes of the induced or repressed genes. The pathogenicity island LEE showed highest transcriptional activity in LB medium, minimal medium, and after treatment with antibiotics. Unique sets of genes, including many hypothetical genes, are highly up-regulated on radish sprouts, cattle feces, or in the presence of antibiotics. Furthermore, we observed induction of the shiga-toxin carrying phages by antibiotics and confirmed active biofilm related genes on radish sprouts, in cattle feces, and on agar plates.
   Conclusions: Since only a minority of genes (2.7%) were not active under any condition tested (null reads), we suggest that the assumption of significant genome over-annotations is wrong. Environmental transcriptomics uncovered hitherto unknown gene functions and unique regulatory patterns in EHEC. For instance, the environmental function of azoR had been elusive, but this gene is highly active on radish sprouts. Thus, NGS-transcriptomics is an appropriate technique to propose new roles of hypothetical genes and to guide future research.

AB Virioplankton have a significant role in marine ecosystems, yet we know little of the predominant biological characteristics of aquatic viruses that influence the flow of nutrients and energy through microbial communities. Family A DNA polymerases, critical to DNA replication and repair in prokaryotes, are found in many tailed bacteriophages. The essential role of DNA polymerase in viral replication makes it a useful target for connecting viral diversity with an important biological feature of viruses. Capturing the full diversity of this polymorphic gene by targeted approaches has been difficult; thus, full-length DNA polymerase genes were assembled out of virioplankton shotgun metagenomic sequence libraries (viromes). Within the viromes novel DNA polymerases were common and found in both double-stranded (ds) DNA and single-stranded (ss) DNA libraries. Finding DNA polymerase genes in ssDNA viral libraries was unexpected, as no such genes have been previously reported from ssDNA phage. Surprisingly, the most common virioplankton DNA polymerases were related to a siphovirus infecting an alpha-proteobacterial symbiont of a marine sponge and not the podoviral T7-like polymerases seen in many other studies. Amino acids predictive of catalytic efficiency and fidelity linked perfectly to the environmental clades, indicating that most DNA polymerase-carrying virioplankton utilize a lower efficiency, higher fidelity enzyme. Comparisons with previously reported, PCR-amplified DNA polymerase sequences indicated that the most common virioplankton metagenomic DNA polymerases formed a new group that included siphoviruses. These data indicate that slower-replicating, lytic or lysogenic phage populations rather than fast-replicating, highly lytic phages may predominate within the virioplankton.

AB Background: Sex presents evolutionary costs and benefits, leading to the expectation that the amount of genetic exchange should vary in conditions with contrasting cost-benefit equations. Like eukaryotes, viruses also engage in sex, but the rate of genetic exchange is often assumed to be a relatively invariant property of a particular virus. However, the rates of genetic exchange can vary within one type of virus according to geography, as highlighted by phylogeographic studies of cystoviruses. Here we merge environmental microbiology with experimental evolution to examine sex in a diverse set of cystoviruses, consisting of the bacteriophage phi 6 and its relatives. To quantify reassortment we manipulated by experimental evolution electrophoretic mobility of intact virus particles for use as a phenotypic marker to estimate genetic exchange.
   Results: We generated descendants of phi 6 that exhibited fast and slow mobility during gel electrophoresis. We identified mutations associated with slow and fast phenotypes using whole genome sequencing and used crosses to establish the production of hybrids of intermediate mobility. We documented natural variation in electrophoretic mobility among environmental isolates of cystoviruses and used crosses against a common fast mobility phi 6 strain to monitor the production of hybrids with intermediate mobility, thus estimating the amount of genetic exchange. Cystoviruses from different geographic locations have very different reassortment rates when measured against phi 6, with viruses isolated from California showing higher reassortment rates than those from the Northeastern US.
   Conclusions: The results confirm that cystoviruses from different geographic locations have remarkably different reassortment rates -despite similar genome structure and replication mechanisms-and that these differences are in large part due to sexual reproduction. This suggests that particular viruses may indeed exhibit diverse sexual behavior, but wide geographic sampling, across varying environmental conditions may be necessary to characterize the full repertoire. Variation in reassortment rates can assist in the delineation of viral populations and is likely to provide insight into important viral evolutionary dynamics including the rate of coinfection, virulence, and host range shifts. Electrophoretic mobility may be an indicator of important determinants of fitness and the techniques herein can be applied to the study of other viruses.

AB The evolutionary adaptation of bacteriophages to their environment is achieved by alterations of their genomes involving a combination of both point mutations and lateral gene transfer. A phylogenetic analysis of a large set of collar fiber protein (fibritin) loci from diverse T4-like phages indicates that nearly all the modular swapping involving the C-terminal domain of this gene occurred in the distant past and has since ceased. In phage T4, this fibritin domain encodes the sequence that mediates both the attachment of the long tail fibers to the virion and also controls, in an environmentally sensitive way, the phage's ability to infect its host bacteria. Subsequent to its distant period of modular exchange, the evolution of fibritin has proceeded primarily by the slow vertical divergence mechanism. We suggest that ancient and sudden changes in the environment forced the T4-like phages to alter fibritin's mode of action or function. The genome's response to such episodes of rapid environmental change could presumably only be achieved quickly enough by employing the modular evolution mechanism. A phylogenetic analysis of the fibritin locus reveals the possible traces of such events within the T4 superfamily's genomes.

AB Microbes drive the biogeochemical cycles that fuel planet Earth, and their viruses (phages) alter microbial population structure, genome repertoire, and metabolic capacity. However, our ability to understand and quantify phage-host interactions is technique-limited. Here, we introduce phageFISH -a markedly improved geneFISH protocol that increases gene detection efficiency from 40% to > 92% and is optimized for detection and visualization of intra-and extracellular phage DNA. The application of phageFISH to characterize infection dynamics in a marine podovirus-gammaproteobacterial host model system corroborated classical metrics (qPCR, plaque assay, FVIC, DAPI) and outperformed most of them to reveal new biology. PhageFISH detected both replicating and encapsidated (intracellular and extracellular) phage DNA, while simultaneously identifying and quantifying host cells during all stages of infection. Additionally, phageFISH allowed per-cell relative measurements of phage DNA, enabling single-cell documentation of infection status (e.g. early vs late stage infections). Further, it discriminated between two waves of infection, which no other measurement could due to population-averaged signals. Together, these findings richly characterize the infection dynamics of a novel model phage-host system, and debut phageFISH as a much-needed tool for studying phage-host interactions in the laboratory, with great promise for environmental surveys and lineage-specific population ecology of free phages.

AB To obtain genetic information and to evaluate the composition of T4-type bacteriophage (phage) communities in wetlands, environmental soil and water DNAs were obtained from two natural wetlands dominated by Carex lasiocarpa and Deyeuxia angustifolia plant species, and a neighboring paddy field in Sanjiang plain of northeast China. The biomarker gene of g23, which encodes the major capsid protein of T4-type phages, was amplified with primers MZIA1bis and MZIA6, and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. In total, 96 and 50 different g23 clones were obtained from natural wetlands and a paddy field, respectively. A larger number of clones with low levels of identity to known sequences were found in water than in soil both in the natural wetlands and the paddy field, suggesting that many of T4-type phages in wetland water and paddy floodwater in Sanjiang plain are uncharacterized. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the g23 clones in natural wetlands, irrespective of water and soil, were distinctly different from those in marine waters, lake waters, and upland black soils, but were similar to those in paddy fields. The UniFrac analysis of g23 assemblages indicated that T4-type phage community compositions were different between soils and waters, and also were different between the natural wetlands and the paddy field. In general, the global analysis of g23 clone assemblages demonstrated that T4-type phage community compositions were different among natural wetlands, marines, lakes, paddy fields, and upland black soils.

AB Bacteria and their viruses (phage) are fundamental drivers of many ecosystem processes including global biogeochemistry and horizontal gene transfer. While databases and resources for studying function in uncultured bacterial communities are relatively advanced, many fewer exist for their viral counterparts. The issue is largely technical in that the majority (often 90%) of viral sequences are functionally 'unknown' making viruses a virtually untapped resource of functional and physiological information. Here, we provide a community resource that organizes this unknown sequence space into 27 K high confidence protein clusters using 32 viral metagenomes from four biogeographic regions in the Pacific Ocean that vary by season, depth, and proximity to land, and include some of the first deep pelagic ocean viral metagenomes. These protein clusters more than double currently available viral protein clusters, including those from environmental datasets. Further, a protein cluster guided analysis of functional diversity revealed that richness decreased (i) from deep to surface waters, (ii) from winter to summer, (iii) and with distance from shore in surface waters only. These data provide a framework from which to draw on for future metadata-enabled functional inquiries of the vast viral unknown.

AB Many laboratories are actively studying the abundance and roles of viruses in natural ecosystems. In these studies, the presence and number of viral particles is usually determined using fluorescent dyes. However, DNA associated with membrane-derived vesicles (MVs), gene transfer agents (GTAs), or cell debris can produce fluorescent dots that can be confused with viral particles. We suspect that fluorescence counting can lead to overestimation of virus numbers and even suggest the presence of viruses when there are none. Future studies in environmental virology should acknowledge this point and consider how to bypass this problem. Besides trying to improve discrimination between virions and MVs, we suggest adopting less holistic approaches, focusing on the detection of known virus groups and the isolation of new viruses from a broader range of hosts.

AB As new environments are studied, viruses consistently emerge as important and prominent players in natural and man-made ecosystems. However, much of what we know is built both upon the foundation of the culturable minority and using methods that are often insufficiently ground-truthed. Here, we review the modern culture-independent viral metagenomic sample-to-sequence pipeline and how next-generation sequencing techniques are drastically altering our ability to systematically and rigorously evaluate them. Together, a series of studies quantitatively evaluate existing and new methods that allow-even for ultra-low DNA samples-the generation of replicable, near-quantitative datasets that maximize inter-comparability and biological inference.

AB Bacteriophages are likely the most abundant entities in the aquatic environment, yet knowledge of their ecology is limited. During a fecal source-tracking study, two genetically novel Leviviridae strains were discovered. Although the novel strains were isolated from coastal waters 1130 km apart (North Carolina and Rhode Island, USA), these strains shared 97% nucleotide similarity and 97-100% amino acid similarity. When the novel strains were compared to nine Levivirus genogroup I strains, they shared 95-100% similarity among the maturation, capsid and lysis proteins, but only 84-85% in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. Further bioinformatic analyses suggested a recombination event occurred. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of viral recombinants in environmental Leviviridae ssRNA bacteriophages.

AB We report on a genomic and functional analysis of a novel marine siphovirus, the Vibrio phage SIO-2. This phage is lytic for related Vibrio species of great ecological interest including the broadly antagonistic bacterium Vibrio sp. SWAT3 as well as notable members of the Harveyi clade (V. harveyi ATTC BAA-1116 and V. campbellii ATCC 25920). Vibrio phage SIO-2 has a circularly permuted genome of 80 598 bp, which displays unusual features. This genome is larger than that of most known siphoviruses and only 38 of the 116 predicted proteins had homologues in databases. Another divergence is manifest by the origin of core genes, most of which share robust similarities with unrelated viruses and bacteria spanning a wide range of phyla. These core genes are arranged in the same order as in most bacteriophages but they are unusually interspaced at two places with insertions of DNA comprising a high density of uncharacterized genes. The acquisition of these DNA inserts is associated with morphological variation of SIO-2 capsid, which assembles as a large (80 nm) shell with a novel T = 12 symmetry. These atypical structural features confer on SIO-2 a remarkable stability to a variety of physical, chemical and environmental factors. Given this high level of functional and genomic novelty, SIO-2 emerges as a model of considerable interest in ecological and evolutionary studies.

AB Microbial processes largely control the health and resilience of coral reef ecosystems, and new technologies have led to an exciting wave of discovery regarding the mechanisms by which microbial communities support the functioning of these incredibly diverse and valuable systems. There are three questions at the forefront of discovery: What mechanisms underlie coral reef health and resilience? How do environmental and anthropogenic pressures affect ecosystem function? What is the ecology of microbial diseases of corals? The goal is to understand the functioning of coral reefs as integrated systems from microbes and molecules to regional and ocean-basin scale ecosystems to enable accurate predictions of resilience and responses to perturbations such as climate change and eutrophication. This review outlines recent discoveries regarding the microbial ecology of different microenvironments within coral ecosystems, and highlights research directions that take advantage of new technologies to build a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how coral health is connected through microbial processes to its surrounding environment. The time is ripe for natural resource managers and microbial ecologists to work together to create an integrated understanding of coral reef functioning. In the context of long-term survival and conservation of reefs, the need for this work is immediate.

AB Aim: To conduct epidemiological and ecological surveillance of cholera in freshwater environments.
   Methods and Results: A freshwater region of India was surveyed between April 2007 and December 2008. Vibrio cholerae was isolated from 59.5% of water and plankton samples (n = 357) and 35.5% of stool samples (n = 290). Isolation from water was dependent on air (r = 0 44) and water temperatures (r = 0 49) (P < 0 01) but was independent of rainfall (r = 0 15), chlorophyll a (r = 0 18), salinity (r = 0 2) or pH (r = 0 2) (P > 0 05). Isolation from plankton was dependent on temperature of air (r = 0 45), water temperature (r = 0 44), chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0 42), pH (r = 0 23) and salinity (r = 0 39) (P < 0 01). Cholera cases correlated with rainfall (r = 0 82, P < 0 01) and chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0 42, P < 0 05), but not with air temperature (r = 0 3, P = 0 37). Vibrio cholerae O1 possessed ctxB, ctxA, rstR and tcpA (ElTor), toxR, toxT, rtxA, rtxC, mshA and hylA. Among non-O1-non-O139, the distribution of virulence-associated and regulatory protein genes was heterogeneous with -0.7, 2 2, 94 77, 97 76, 99 25, 100 and 100% isolates being positive for tcpA, toxT, rtxA, rtxC, hylA, toxR and mshA, respectively. Two-thirds of non-O1-non-O139 isolates exhibited antibiotic resistance to various antibiotics that did not correlate with geographical site or time of origin for the isolates. RAPD and AFLP showed V. cholerae to be a diverse bacterium. AFLP demonstrated separate lineages for non-O1-non-O139 and O1 isolates.
   Conclusion: Environmental parameters played a significant role in the emergence and spread of cholera and the abundance of V. cholerae. But based on virulence gene profiling and genetic fingerprinting, the possibility of origin of toxigenic isolates from nontoxigenic environmental isolates seems unlikely in freshwater environs of India.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study explains the ecology, epidemiology and seasonality of cholera in freshwater environs.

AB Purpose of review
   This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of biologic and environmental factors that shape current cholera outbreaks, advances in our understanding of host-pathogen interactions during cholera, and recent evolution of current treatment and cholera prevention strategies.
   Recent findings
   New research studies have improved our understanding of a number of dynamic factors that shape the ecology of Vibrio cholerae and influence its transmission, including the role of lytic bacteriophage, biofilm formation, a hyperinfectious state of human-passaged V. cholerae, and the impact of severe weather events. Provision of safe water and improved sanitation continue to be the mainstays of preventing cholera transmission; however, the role of cholera vaccination as a control measure in both endemic and epidemic settings is evolving. Recent advances in our understanding of long-lived protective immunity after natural infection may aid in the global efforts to control cholera.
   Summary
   Improved understanding of factors associated with protective immunity and dynamic factors associated with cholera outbreaks may lead to improved control and prevention strategies for cholera.

AB Salmonella enterica serovar Napoli is an emerging serovar in Italy, France, and Switzerland, but little is known about its pathogenicity to humans. A collection of 112 strains of Salmonella Napoli isolated in Italy from human cases, foods of animal origin, and the environment have been characterized by the detection of a set of virulence genes, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and antibiotic susceptibility. All the strains examined were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested. The Salmonella pathogenicity islands genes ssaQ, mgtC spi_4D, and sopB were present from 75.0% to 100% of the tested strains. Only one human and four environmental strains showed the avrA gene. The phage-related sopE1 gene was present in 93% of the strains, whereas sodC1 and gipA genes were only in four and two environmental strains, respectively. The bcfC fimbrial gene was present in all the animal/food strains, in the 71.4% of environmental strains, and in 46.8% of the human strains, respectively. Overall, we observed 10 distinct virulence profiles (VP), but VP1-2-3 included 99 out of 112 strains. PFGE showed that 103 out of 111 isolates were grouped in four major clusters and three minor clusters, whereas two strains were totally unrelated. The most represented PFGE clusters mainly correlated with the virulotypes are VP1, VP2, and VP3. Salmonella Napoli shows an array of virulence genes similar to other serovars considered of public health importance and confirming its capability to cause infection in human. Concerning possible source of infection or reservoirs, the results did not point out any, but our hypothesis is that the environment can act as the main reservoir for Salmonella Napoli, and from there it can spill over to animals and humans. Further studies are needed to increase the knowledge on the ecology of Salmonella Napoli serovar and on the main risk factors for human infection.

ID METAGENOMIC ANALYSIS; VIRUSES
AB Viruses, particularly bacteriophages (phages), are the most numerous biological entities on Earth(1,2). Viruses modulate host cell abundance and diversity, contribute to the cycling of nutrients, alter host cell phenotype, and influence the evolution of both host cell and viral communities through the lateral transfer of genes (3). Numerous studies have highlighted the staggering genetic diversity of viruses and their functional potential in a variety of natural environments.
   Metagenomic techniques have been used to study the taxonomic diversity and functional potential of complex viral assemblages whose members contain single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and RNA genotypes (4-9). Current library construction protocols used to study environmental DNA-containing or RNA-containing viruses require an initial nuclease treatment in order to remove nontargeted templates (10). However, a comprehensive understanding of the collective gene complement of the virus community and virus diversity requires knowledge of all members regardless of genome composition. Fractionation of purified nucleic acid subtypes provides an effective mechanism by which to study viral assemblages without sacrificing a subset of the community's genetic signature.
   Hydroxyapatite, a crystalline form of calcium phosphate, has been employed in the separation of nucleic acids, as well as proteins and microbes, since the 1960s(11). By exploiting the charge interaction between the positively-charged Ca2+ ions of the hydroxyapatite and the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid subtypes, it is possible to preferentially elute each nucleic acid subtype independent of the others. We recently employed this strategy to independently fractionate the genomes of ssDNA, dsDNA and RNA-containing viruses in preparation of DNA sequencing (12). Here, we present a method for the fractionation and recovery of ssDNA, dsDNA and RNA viral nucleic acids from mixed viral assemblages using hydroxyapatite chromotography.

AB DNA polymerase gamma is a family A DNA polymerase responsible for the replication of mitochondrial DNA in eukaryotes. The origins of DNA polymerase gamma have remained elusive because it is not present in any known bacterium, though it has been hypothesized that mitochondria may have inherited the enzyme by phage-mediated nonorthologous displacement. Here, we present an analysis of two full-length homologues of this gene, which were found in the genomes of two bacteriophages, which infect the chlorophyll-d containing cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina. Phylogenetic analyses of these phage DNA polymerase gamma proteins show that they branch deeply within the DNA polymerase gamma clade and therefore share a common origin with their eukaryotic homologues. We also found homologues of these phage polymerases in the environmental Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis (CAMERA) database, which fell in the same clade. An analysis of the CAMERA assemblies containing the environmental homologues together with the filter fraction metadata indicated some of these assemblies may be of bacterial origin. We also show that the phage-encoded DNA polymerase gamma is highly transcribed as the phage genomes are replicated. These findings provide data that may assist in reconstructing the evolution of mitochondria.

TI A protocol for enumeration of aquatic viruses by epifluorescence

AB Background: Epifluorescence microscopy is a common method used to enumerate virus-like particles (VLP) from environmental samples and relies on the use of filter membranes with pore sizes < 0.02 mu m; the most commonly used protocols employ 25 mm Anodisc (TM) membranes with a built-in support ring. Other filters with small pore sizes exist, including the 13 mm Anodisc (TM) membranes without a support ring. However, the use of these membranes for viral enumeration has not been previously reported.
   Results: Here we describe a modified protocol for 13 mm Anodisc membranes that uses a custom filter holder that can be readily constructed in individual investigators' laboratories from commercially available Swinnex (R) filter holders. We compared VLP concentrations obtained from phage lysates and seawater samples using both Anodisc membranes, as well as Nuclepore (TM) small pore-size membranes (0.015 or 0.030 mu m). The 13 mm Anodisc membranes gave comparable estimates of VLP abundance to those obtained with the 25 mm Anodisc membranes when similar staining methods were employed. Both Nuclepore membranes typically gave an order of magnitude lower VLP abundance values for environmental samples.
   Conclusions: The 13 mm Anodisc membranes are less costly and require smaller sample volumes than their 25 mm counterpart making them ideal for large-scale studies and sample replication. This method increases the options of reliable approaches available for quantifying VLP from environmental samples.

AB The Chesapeake Bay, a seasonally variable temperate estuary, provides a natural laboratory for examining the fluctuations and impacts of viral lysis on aquatic microorganisms. Viral abundance (VA) and viral production (VP) were monitored in the Chesapeake Bay over 4 1/2 annual cycles, producing a unique, long-term, interannual study of virioplankton production. High and dynamic VP rates, averaging 7.9 x 10(6) viruses per mL per h, indicate that viral lysis impacts a significant fraction of microorganisms in the Chesapeake. Viral-mediated bacterial mortality, VA, VP, and organic carbon release all displayed similar interannual and seasonal trends with higher values in 2003 and 2006 than in 2004 and 2005 and peaks in early spring and summer. Surprisingly, higher rates of viral lysis occurred in winter, resulting in a magnified effect of viral lysis on bacterioplankton during times of reduced productivity. Viral lysis directly impacted the organic carbon pool, contributing on average 76 mu g of C per L per d, an amount capable of sustaining similar to 55% of Chesapeake Bay bacterial production. The observed repeating interannual patterns of VP and lysis are likely interlinked with seasonal cycles of host abundance and diversity, which are in turn driven by annual cycles in environmental conditions, emphasizing the complex interplay of seasonality and microbial ecology in the Chesapeake Bay.

AB Heterotrophic bacteria are an integral part of any environmental biotechnology process (EBP). Therefore, factors controlling bacterial abundance, activity, and community composition are central to the understanding of such processes. Among these factors, top-down control by bacteriophage predation has so far received very limited attention. With over 108 particles per ml, phage appear to be the most numerous biological entities in EBP. Phage populations in EBP appear to be highly dynamic and to correlate with the population dynamics of their hosts and genomic evidence suggests bacteria evolve to avoid phage predation. Clearly, there is much to learn regarding bacteriophage in EBP before we can truly understand the microbial ecology of these globally important systems.

AB Viruses are recognized as the most abundant biological components on Earth, and they regulate the structure of microbial communities in many environments. In soil and marine environments, microorganism-infecting phages are the most common type of virus. Although several types of bacteriophage have been isolated from fermented foods, little is known about the overall viral assemblages (viromes) of these environments. In this study, metagenomic analyses were performed on the uncultivated viral communities from three fermented foods, fermented shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique, a total of 81,831, 70,591 and 69,464 viral sequences were obtained from fermented shrimp, kimchi and sauerkraut, respectively. Moreover, 37 to 50% of these sequences showed no significant hit against sequences in public databases. There were some discrepancies between the prediction of bacteriophages hosts via homology comparison and bacterial distribution, as determined from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These discrepancies likely reflect the fact that the viral genomes of fermented foods are poorly represented in public databases. Double-stranded DNA viral communities were amplified from fermented foods by using a linker-amplified shotgun library. These communities were dominated by bacteriophages belonging to the viral order Caudovirales (i.e., Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae). This study indicates that fermented foods contain less complex viral communities than many other environmental habitats, such as seawater, human feces, marine sediment, and soil.

AB In the past few years, the field of metagenomics has been growing at an accelerated pace, particularly in response to advancements in new sequencing technologies. The large volume of sequence data from novel organisms generated by metagenomic projects has triggered the development of specialized databases and tools focused on particular groups of organisms or data types. Here we describe a pipeline for the functional annotation of viral metagenomic sequence data. The Viral MetaGenome Annotation Pipeline (VMGAP) pipeline takes advantage of a number of specialized databases, such as collections of mobile genetic elements and environmental metagenomes to improve the classification and functional prediction of viral gene products. The pipeline assigns a functional term to each predicted protein sequence following a suite of comprehensive analyses whose results are ranked according to a priority rules hierarchy. Additional annotation is provided in the form of enzyme commission (EC) numbers, GO/MeGO terms and Hidden Markov Models together with supporting evidence.

AB Recent metagenomic sequencing studies of uncultured viral populations have provided novel insights into the ecology of environmental bacteriophage. At the same time, viral metagenomes could also represent a potential source of recombinant proteins with biotechnological value. In order to identify such proteins, a novel two-step screening technique was devised for cloning phage lytic enzymes from uncultured viral DNA. This plasmid-based approach first involves a primary screen in which transformed Escherichia coli clones that demonstrate colony lysis following exposure to inducing agent are identified. This effect, which can be due to the expression of membrane-permeabilizing phage holins, is discerned by the development a hemolytic effect in surrounding blood agar. In a secondary step, the clones identified in the primary screen are overlaid with autoclaved Gram-negative bacteria (specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to assay directly for recombinant expression of lytic enzymes, which are often encoded proximally to holins in phage genomes. As proof-ofprinciple, the method was applied to a viral metagenomic library constructed from mixed animal feces, and 26 actively expressed lytic enzymes were cloned. These proteins include both Gram-positive-like and Gram-negative-like enzymes, as well as several atypical lysins whose predicted structures are less common among known phage. Overall, this study represents one of the first functional screens of a viral metagenomic population, and it provides a general approach for characterizing lysins from uncultured phage.

AB From genomic sequencing it has become apparent that the marine cyanomyoviruses capable of infecting strains of unicellular cyanobacteria assigned to the genera Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are not only morphologically similar to T4, but are also genetically related, typically sharing some 40-48 genes. The large majority of these common genes are the same in all marine cyanomyoviruses so far characterized. Given the fundamental physiological differences between marine unicellular cyanobacteria and heterotrophic hosts of T4-like phages it is not surprising that the study of cyanomyoviruses has revealed novel and fascinating facets of the phage-host relationship. One of the most interesting features of the marine cyanomyoviruses is their possession of a number of genes that are clearly of host origin such as those involved in photosynthesis, like the psbA gene that encodes a core component of the photosystem II reaction centre. Other host-derived genes encode enzymes involved in carbon metabolism, phosphate acquisition and ppGpp metabolism. The impact of these host-derived genes on phage fitness has still largely to be assessed and represents one of the most important topics in the study of this group of T4-like phages in the laboratory. However, these phages are also of considerable environmental significance by virtue of their impact on key contributors to oceanic primary production and the true extent and nature of this impact has still to be accurately assessed.

AB Aims:
   This study aims to investigate the ecology of coliphages, an important microbial pollution indicator. Specifically, our experiments address (i) the ability of environmental Escherichia coli (E. coli) to serve as hosts for coliphage replication, and (ii) the temporal and spatial distribution of coliphages in coastal waters.
   Methods and Results:
   Water samples from three locations in California's Newport Bay watershed were tested for the presence of coliphages every 2 weeks for an entire year. A total of nine E. coli strains isolated from various sources served as hosts for coliphage detection. Coliphage occurrence was significantly different between freshwater, estuarine and coastal locations and correlated with water temperature, salinity and rainfall in the watershed. The coliphages isolated on the environmental hosts had a broad host-range relative to the coliphages isolated on an E. coli strain from sewage and a US EPA recommended strain for coliphage detection.
   Conclusions:
   Coliphage occurrence was related to the temperature, rainfall and salinity within the bay. The adaptation to a broad host-range may enable the proliferation of coliphages in the aquatic environment.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   Understanding the seasonal variation of phages is useful for establishing a background level of coliphage presence in coastal waters. The broad host-range of coliphages isolated on the environmental E. coli host calls for investigation of coliphage replication in the aquatic environment.

AB Silicification of organisms in silica-depositing environments can impact both their ecology and their presence in the fossil record. Although microbes have been silicified under laboratory and environmental conditions, viruses have not. Bacteriophage T4 was successfully silicified under laboratory conditions that closely simulated those found in silica-depositing hot springs. Virus morphology was maintained, and a clear elemental signature of phosphorus was detected by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrophotometry (EDS).

AB We have developed a method for the detection of viruses in environmental samples that we have called enterophages, that specifically infect Enterococcus faecalis. This method has allowed us to determine the prevalence and to study the ecology of this group of phages. The enterophages replicate at 37 degrees C, and at 41 degrees C. The presence of NaN3 in the media inhibits the growth of background microbiota and allows an accurate, specific and rapid detection of these viruses. Enterophages were present in raw domestic sewage at lower concentrations (average 1.8 x 10(2) PFU/100 mL) than those of coliphages (average 1.7 x 10(5) PFU/100 mL). Phages were characterised by transmission electron microscopy showing icosahedral capsids, some with non-contractile tails as well as icosahedral non-tailed capsids. Different isolates had capsid sizes ranging from 20 nm to about 75 nm in diameter. These data describe a new group of phages that may serve as alternate indicators of human faecal pollution, especially in recreational waters. The ecology of these enterophages indicates that these may be strictly of human origin.

AB A novel cryptic plasmid, pMP1, from an environmental Vibrio vulnificus MP-4 isolated from Mai Po Nature Reserve in Hong Kong, has been characterized. The 7.6-kb plasmid had guanine-cytosine content of 40.03% and encoded four open reading frames (ORFs) with > 100 amino acids. The predicted protein of ORF1 contained 478 amino acids showing 29% identity and 50% similarity over 309 amino acids to the integrase of Vibrio cholerae phage VP2. ORF2 encoded a putative protein of 596 amino acids, which were 23% identity and 42% similarity over 455 amino acids to the tail tape measure protein TP901 of Chromohalobacter salexigens phage. ORF3 and ORF4 encoded putative proteins of 103 and 287 amino acids, respectively, but showed no homologies to any known proteins. Further experiments indicated that a 3.2-kb fragment from EcoRI digestion could self-replicate. Analysis indicated that a sequence upstream of ORF4 had the features characteristic of theta-type replicons: AT-rich region, six potential direct repeats (iterons) spaced approximately two DNA helical turn apart (about 23 bp), two copies of 9 bp dnaA boxes, three Dam methylation sites, and five inverted repeats. Complementation experiments confirmed that the protein encoded by ORF4 was required for plasmid replication. We propose that ORF4 encode a new type of Rep protein and pMP1 is a new type of theta plasmid.

AB In this review, available data on the structure (diversity, abundance, biomass) and functional imprints (bacteriolysis, lysogeny, gene transfers, regulation of prokaryotic diversity) of natural viruses in the context of food webs in aquatic microbial ecology, and the related biogeochemical cycles, are summarized. Viruses are the most abundant, and probably the most diverse, biological entities in aquatic ecosystems and in the biosphere (i.e., viriosphere). Aquatic viruses typically exceed 10(7) particles/mL in mesotrophic conditions, the majority being represented by phages without tails and by tailed-phages such as members of the family Siphoviridae. Both types of phages have a small capsid and a small genome size, which is considered an evolutionary adaptation to planktonic life. Their contribution to microbial mortality is significant. There is strong evidence that phages exert a significant pressure on the community structure and diversity and on the diversification of potential hosts, mainly through two major pathways: biogeochemical catalysis from lysis products and horizontal gene transfers. In turn, phages are sensitive to environmental factors, both in terms of integrity and of infectivity. Some phages contain typical viral genes that code for biological functions of interest, such as photosynthesis. In general, development in viral ecology is a source of new knowledge for the scientific community in the domain of environmental sciences, but also in the context of evolutionary biology of living cellular organisms, the obligatory hosts for viruses. For example, the recent discovery of a giant virus that becomes ill through infection by another virus (i.e., a viriophage) is fuelling debate about whether viruses are alive. Finally, future research directions are identified in the context of general aquatic ecology, including ecological researches on cyanophages and other phytoplanktonic phages as a priority, primarily in freshwater lakes.

AB Invading an occupied niche is a formidable ecological challenge, and one of particular human importance in the context of food-borne microbial pathogens. We discuss distinct categories of invader-triggered environmental change that facilitate invasion by emptying their niche of competitors. Evidence is reviewed that gut bacteria use such strategies to manipulate their environment (via bacteriocins, temperate phage viruses or immuno-manipulation) at the expense of their competitors are reviewed. The possible virulence implications of microbial warfare among multiple co-infecting strains are diverse. Killing competitors can reduce virulence by reducing overall microbial densities, or increase virulence if for example the allelopathic mechanism involves immuno-manipulation. Finally, we place microbial anti-competitor strategies in a social evolution framework, highlighting how costly anti-competitor strategies can be understood as examples of microbial spite. We conclude by discussing other invasive species that have also developed such proactive strategies of invasion.

AB Bacterlophages (phages) are the viruses of bacteria and the study of phage biology can be differentiated, roughly, into molecular, environmental, evolutionary, ecological, and applied aspects. While for much of the past fifty-plus years molecular and then applied aspects have dominated the field, more recently environmental concerns, especially the phage impact on biogeochemical cycles, have driven an increase in the appreciation of phage ecology. Over approximately the same time frame, decreasing sequencing costs have combined with phage molecular characterization to give rise to an inescapable consideration of phage comparative genomics. That, along with environmental metagenomics, has stimulated, especially among molecular biologists, a more general interest in phage evolutionary biology. However, while reviews of phage ecology have become exceedingly common, overviews of phage evolutionary biology are comparatively rare, and broad considerations of phage evolutionary biology drawn from an ecological perspective rarer still. In this chapter I jump into this latter void, providing an overview of phage evolutionary biology as viewed from the perspective of phage-environment interactions, that is, from the perspective of phage ecology. This I do over five sections constituting (1) an introduction to phages and how, phenotypically, they can be differentiated into three basics types that correlate, more or less, with genomic size, that is, tailed (generally larger genomes), lipid-containing (medium-sized genomes), and single-stranded (small genomes); (2) a brief introduction to phage ecology as considered particularly from a classical ecological perspective; (3) an extended introduction to evolutionary biology as viewed from a phage and phage-ecological standpoint; (4) phage evolutionary ecology, that is, consideration of phage adaptations from the vantage of why, in terms of phage fitness, those adaptations may have evolved; and (5) phage evolutionary biology, including evolutionary ecology, as viewed from the perspective of phage genomics.

AB Even though at least 400 Listeria phages have been isolated from various sources, limited information is available on phages from the food processing plant environment. Phages in the processing plant environment may play critical roles in determining the Listeria population that becomes established in the plant. In this study, we pursued the isolation of Listeria-specific phages from environmental samples from four turkey processing plants in the United States. These environmental samples were also utilized to isolate Listeria spp. Twelve phages were isolated and classified into three groups in terms of their host range. Of these, nine (group 1) showed a wide host range, including multiple serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes, as well as other Listeria spp. (L. innocua, L. welshimeri, L. seeligeri, and L. ivanovii). The remaining phages mostly infected L. monocytogenes serotype 4b as well as L. innocua, L. ivanovii, and/or L. welshimeri. All but one of the strains of the serotype 4b complex (4b, 4d, 4e) from the processing plant environment could be readily infected by the wide-host-range phages isolated from the environment of the processing plants. However, many strains of other serotypes (1/2a [or 3a] and 1/2b [or 3b]), which represented the majority of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from the environmental samples, were resistant to infection by these phages. Experiments with two phageresistant strains showed reduced phage adsorption onto the host cells. These findings suggest that phage resistance may be an important component of the ecology of L. monocytogenes in the turkey processing plants.

AB Central to most theories that explain the diversity of life is the concept that organisms face trade-offs. Theoretical work has shown that the precise shape of a trade-off relationship affects evolutionary predictions. One common trade-off is that between competitive ability and resistance to predators, parasitoids, pathogens or herbivores. We used a microbial experimental system to elucidate the shape of the relationship between parasitoid resistance and competitive ability. For each of 86 bacteriophage-resistant isolates of the bacterium Escherichia coli B, we measured the degree of resistance to bacteriophage T2 (a viral parasitoid) and relative competitive ability in both the resource environment in which strains were isolated and in two alternate environments. We observed that environmental change can alter trade-off shape, and that different physiological mechanisms can lead to different trade-off shapes and different sensitivities to environmental change. These results highlight the important interaction between environment and trade-off shape in affecting ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

AB Vibrio cholerae isolates from environmental and clinical origins in the Bengal region in which epidemics of cholera break out periodically were analyzed with particular emphasis on the molecular epidemiological features. The presence of the virulence genes (ctxA, tcpA and toxR) in the isolates was analyzed by the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method. PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) was performed to determine the clonal relationships between the clinical and environmental strains. Antiblograms and O serovars of the isolates were also examined. O1 and O139 strains from both clinical and environmental sources were all positive for the three virulence genes while non-O1/non-O139 strains from both sources were all negative for ctxA and tcpA but positive for toxR. PFGE patterns of recent isolates of O1 and O139 were similar in each serovar regardless of origin, suggesting a clonal relationship between the clinical and environmental strains, although comparison with past isolates or isolates from different geographical area showed some differences.

AB In view of various studies looking for the merit of coliphages as indicators of water pollution with viruses originating from faecal material, a small agricultural community (population of approximately 1500 inhabitants of all ages, 2-3 km from Haifa) was selected in order to understand these bacteriophage ecology (F-RNA and somatic coliphages) in its sewer and oxidation pond system. Along the sewer lines, it was possible to isolate constantly both bacteriophage types (F-RNA and somatic coliphages) at 10(2)-10(4) plaque-forming units (pfu) ml(-1). The average numbers of somatic and F-RNA phages isolated from oxidation pond were 10(3)-10(4) pfu ml(-1); however, somatic coliphages were undetectable for several months (April-August). Significant high correlation (0.944 < R-2 < 0.99) was found between increased anionic detergent concentrations and F-RNA coliphage numbers. Infants less than 1 year old excreted both phage types and few only F-RNA coliphages (at high numbers > 10(5) pfu g(-1)) for up to 1 year. The excretion of F-RNA coliphages was highly linked to Escherichia coli F+ harborage in the intestinal track as found in their faecal content. Finally, three bacterial hosts E. coli F+, F- and CN13 tested for survivability in sewage filtrate revealed that E. coli F+ had the highest survivability under these conditions. Presence of somatic and F male-specific phages in sewer lines of a small community are influenced by several factors such as: anionic detergents, nutrients, temperature, source (mainly infants), shedding and survival capability of the host strain. Better understanding of coliphages ecology in sewer systems can enhance our evaluation of these proposed indicator/index microorganisms used in tracking environmental pollution of water, soil and crop contamination with faecal material containing enteric viruses.

AB In this study we present a bacteriophage isolated from the Great Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge (GSP) that is shown to have a genome size of 340 kb, unusually large for a bacterial virus. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the virion showed this to be a Myoviridae, the first reported to infect the genus Halomonas. This temperate phage, Phi gspC, exhibits a broad host range, displaying the ability to infect two different Halomonas spp. also isolated from the GSP. The phage infection process demonstrates a high level of tolerance towards temperature, pH and salinity; however, free virions are rapidly inactivated in water unless supplemented with salt. We show that susceptibility to osmotic shock is correlated with the density of the packaged DNA (rho(pack)). Lysogens of Halomonas salina GSP21 were detrimental to host fitness at 10% salinity, but the lysogen was able to grow faster than the wild type at 20% salinity. From these results we propose that the extensive genome of Phi gspC may encode environmentally relevant genes (ERGs); genes that are perhaps not essential for the phage life cycle but increase host and phage fitness in some environmental conditions.

AB The use of phages for disease control is a fast expanding area of plant protection with great potential to replace the chemical control measures now prevalent. Phages can be used effectively as part of integrated disease management strategies. The relative ease of preparing phage treatments and low cost of production of these agents make them good candidates for widespread use in developing countries as well. However, the efficacy of phages, as is true of many biological control agents, depends greatly on prevailing environmental factors as well as on susceptibility of the target organism. Great care is necessary during development, production and application of phage treatments. In addition, constant monitoring for the emergence of resistant bacterial strains is essential. Phage-based disease control management is a dynamic process with a need for continuous adjustment of the phage preparation in order to effectively fight potentially adapting pathogenic bacteria.

AB Bacteria carrying resistance genes for many antibiotics are moving beyond the clinic into the community, infecting otherwise healthy people with untreatable and frequently fatal infections. This state of affairs makes it increasingly important that we understand the sources of this problem in terms of bacterial biology and ecology and also that we find some new targets for drugs that will help control this growing epidemic. This brief and eclectic review takes the perspective that we have too long thought about the problem in terms of treatment with or resistance to a single antibiotic at a time, assuming that dissemination of the resistance gene was affected by simple vertical inheritance. In reality antibiotic resistance genes are readily transferred horizontally, even to and from distantly related bacteria. The common agents of bacterial gene transfer are described and also one of the processes whereby nonantibiotic chemicals, specifically toxic metals, in the environment can select for and enrich bacteria with antibiotic multiresistance. Lastly, some speculation is offered on broadening our perspective on this problem to include drugs directed at compromising the ability of the mobile elements themselves to replicate, transfer, and recombine, that is, the three "infrastructure'' processes central to the movement of genes among bacteria.

AB Viruses are the most common biological entities in the marine environment. There has not been a global survey of these viruses, and consequently, it is not known what types of viruses are in Earth's oceans or how they are distributed. Metagenomic analyses of 184 viral assemblages collected over a decade and representing 68 sites in four major oceanic regions showed that most of the viral sequences were not similar to those in the current databases. There was a distinct "marine-ness'' quality to the viral assemblages. Global diversity was very high, presumably several hundred thousand of species, and regional richness varied on a North-South latitudinal gradient. The marine regions had different assemblages of viruses. Cyanophages and a newly discovered clade of single-stranded DNA phages dominated the Sargasso Sea sample, whereas prophage-like sequences were most common in the Arctic. However most viral species were found to be widespread. With a majority of shared species between oceanic regions, most of the differences between viral assemblages seemed to be explained by variation in the occurrence of the most common viral species and not by exclusion of different viral genomes. These results support the idea that viruses are widely dispersed and that local environmental conditions enrich for certain viral types through selective pressure.

AB Soil represents the principal environmental reservoir of many insect-pathogenic viruses. We compared the adsorption and infectivity of one occluded and two nonoccluded viruses, Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaSNPV) (Baculoviridae), Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) (Dicistroviridae), and Invertebrate iridescent virus 6 (IIV-6) (Iridoviridae), respectively, in mixtures with a selection of soil-forming minerals. The relative infective titers of HaSNPV and CrPV were unchanged or slightly reduced in the presence of different minerals compared to their titers in the absence of the mineral. In contrast, the infective titer of IIV-6 varied according to the mineral being tested. In adsorption studies, over 98% of HaSNPV occlusion bodies were adsorbed by all the minerals, and a particularly high affinity was observed with ferric oxide, attapulgite, and kaolinite. In contrast, the adsorption of CrPV and IIV-6 differed markedly with mineral type, with low affinity to bentonites and high affinity to ferric oxide and kaolinite. We conclude that interactions between soil-formirig minerals and insect viruses appear to be most important in nucleopolyhedroviruses, followed by invertebrate iridescent viruses, and least important in CrPV, which may reflect the ecology of these pathogens. Moreover, soils with a high content of iron oxides or kaolinite would likely represent highly effective reservoirs for insect-pathogenic viruses.

AB Isolation and characterization of new environmental bacteriophages are performed for (1) analyzing microbial evolution and ecology and (2) delivering biological therapy. The sampling of environmental bacteriophages appears, however, to be limited by the procedure (usually liquid enrichment culture) used to propagate them. An alternative, less competitive procedure is developed here for the purpose of isolating new bacteriophages. This procedure involves extraction directly into and then propagation in a dilute agarose gel. Adaptations of this procedure are used to avoid repeated isolation of the same bacteriophage. Some newly isolated bacteriophages grow so poorly that they appear inaccessible to liquid enrichment culture. Four comparatively high titer bacteriophages were isolated and characterized by a genomic sequence survey. Some had genomes with extremely distant relationships to those of other bacteriophages, based on a tree built from the large terminase genes. These methods find novel genomes by rapidly isolating and screening diverse bacteriophages. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The finding that total viral abundance is higher than total prokaryotic abundance and that a significant fraction of the prokaryotic community is infected with phages in aquatic systems has stimulated research on the ecology of prokaryotic viruses and their role in ecosystems. This review treats the ecology of prokaryotic viruses (phages') in marine, freshwater and soil systems from a,virus point of view'. The abundance of viruses varies strongly in different environments and is related to bacterial abundance or activity suggesting that the majority of the viruses found in the environment are typically phages. Data on phage diversity are sparse but indicate that phages are extremely diverse in natural systems. Lytic phages are predators of prokaryotes, whereas lysogenic and chronic infections represent a parasitic interaction. Some forms of lysogeny might be described best as mutualism. The little existing ecological data on phage populations indicate a large variety of environmental niches and survival strategies. The host cell is the main resource for phages and the resource quality, i.e., the metabolic state of the host cell, is a critical factor in all steps of the phage life cycle. Virus-induced mortality of prokaryotes varies strongly on a temporal and spatial scale and shows that phages can be important predators of bacterioplankton. This mortality and the release of cell lysis products into the environment can strongly influence microbial food web processes and biogeochemical cycles. Phages can also affect host diversity, e.g., by 'killing the winner' and keeping in check competitively dominant species or populations. Moreover, they mediate gene transfer between prokaryotes, but this remains largely unknown in the environment. Genomics or proteomics are providing us now with powerful tools in phage ecology, but final testing will have to be performed in the environment.

AB Somatic coliphages detected by Escherichia coli strain WG5 have been proposed as potential indicators of water quality. Their potential replication in the water environment is considered a drawback for their use as indicators. However, the contribution of replication outside the gut to the total numbers has never been quantified. It has not been determined either the fraction of bacterial strains that might support replication of phages detected by strain WG5 in the water environment. We examined the sensitivity of 291 host strains to 25 phages by streaking slants of the presumptive host strain onto an agar layer that contains bacteriophages, which gives a total of 7275 combinations (sensitivity tests). Only a 3.02% of the tests showed sensitivity. Additionally, six environmental strains were used as hosts to count phages in sewage and seawater. Phages isolated on these strains were used to infect strain WG5. The environmental strains detected 1 log(10) fewer phages than strain WG5 in sewage and seawater. The fraction of phages that were detected by the six strains and that also infected strain WG5 ranged from < 0.07% to < 2.0% of the total amount of bacteriophages detected by strain WG5 in the same samples. Our results confirm that less than 3% of naturally occurring hosts support replication of phages infecting E. coli. We conclude that the contribution of replication to the number of somatic coliphages detected in the aquatic environment is negligible.

AB Aims: The aim of this work was to isolate bacteriocins from the environment that would be effective in neutralizing Vibrio vulnificus in seafood.
   Methods and Results: Water samples from Wilmington (NC, USA) were plated to determine total viable counts and to isolate presumptive Vibrio spp. Isolates containing plasmids were checked for antimicrobial activity which was not due to lytic bacteriophage or small, non-specific molecules. Three bacteriocin producers were detected and their inhibitory spectra determined: IWI inhibited few strains of V. vulnificus; BC1 inhibited several strains of V vulnificus, V cholerae and V parahaemolyticus and BC2 inhibited all tested Vibrio spp., Plesiomonas shigelloides and Escherichia coli. Loss of inhibitory, activity coincided with loss of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid. The bacteriocins were found to be between 1.3 and 9.0 kDa. IWI was heat labile, while BC1 was moderately stable except at extreme temperatures. BC2 was very stable and maintained its activity when frozen, autoclaved or exposed to extreme pH values
   Conclusions: Bacteriocins have been isolated from environmental isolates of V. vulnificus and V. cholerae. BC2, with its broad spectrum and stability, may, be useful in neutralizing V. vulnificus.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The results have significance in relation to reducing the occurrence of food poisoning caused by V. vulnificus.

AB The virulence of a pathogen is dependent on a discrete set of genetic determinants and their well-regulated expression. The ctxAB and tcpA genes are known to play a cardinal role in maintaining virulence in Vibrio cholerae, and these genes are believed to be exclusively associated with clinical strains of O1 and O139 serogroups. In this study, nle examined the presence of five virulence genes, including ctx;LB and tcpA, as well as toxR and toxT, which are involved in the regulation of virulence, in environmental strains of V. cholerae cultured from three different freshwater lakes and ponds in the eastern part of Calcutta, India. PCR analysis revealed the presence of these virulence genes or their homologues among diverse serotypes and ribotypes of environmental V. cholerae strains. Sequencing of a part of the tcpA gene carried by an environmental strain showed 97.7% homology to the tcpA gene of the classical biotype of V. cholerae O1. Strains carrying the tcpA gene expressed the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), demonstrated by both autoagglutination analysis and electron microscopy of the TCP pill, Strains carrying ctx FB genes also produced cholera toxin, determined by monosialoganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by passage in the ileal loops of rabbits. Thus, this study demonstrates the presence and expression of critical virulence genes or their homologues in diverse environmental strains of V. cholerae, which appear to constitute an environmental reservoir of virulence genes, thereby providing gem insights into the ecology of V. cholerae.

AB A major goal of community ecology is to link biological processes at lower scales with community patterns. Microbial communities are especially powerful model systems for making these links. In this article, we review recent studies of laboratory communities of bacteria and bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria). We focus on the ecology and evolution of bacteriophage-resistance as a case study demonstrating the relationship between specific genes, individual interactions, population dynamics, community structure, and evolutionary change. In laboratory communities of bacteria and bacteriophage, bacteria rapidly evolve resistance to bacteriophage infection. Different resistance mutations produce distinct resistance phenotypes, differing, for example, in whether resistance is partial or complete, in the magnitude of the physiological cost associated with resistance, and in whether the mutation can be countered by a host-range mutation in the bacteriophage. These differences determine whether a mutant can invade, the effect its invasion has on the population dynamics of sensitive bacteria and phage, and the resulting structure of the community. All of these effects, in turn, govern the community's response to environmental change and its subsequent evolution.

AB Context Multidrug-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 has recently emerged as a cause of human and animal illness in Europe and North America. In early 1997, health officials in Yakima County, Washington, noted a 5-fold increase in salmonellosis among the county's Hispanic population.
   Objectives To characterize bacterial strains and identify risk factors for infection with Salmonella Typhimurium in Yakima County.
   Design Laboratory, case-control, and environmental investigations.
   Setting and Participants Patients with culture-confirmed Salmonella Typhimurium infection living in Yakima County and age- and neighborhood-matched control subjects.
   Main Outcome Measures Food vehicle implication based on case-control study and outbreak control.
   Results Between January 1 and May 5, 1997, 54 culture-confirmed cases of Salmonella Typhimurium were reported. The median age of patients was 4 years and 91% were Hispanic. Patients reported diarrhea (100%), abdominal cramps (93%), fever (93%), bloody stools (72%), and vomiting (53%); 5 patients (9%) were hospitalized. Twenty-two patients and 61 control subjects were enrolled in the case-control study. Seventeen case patients (77%) reported eating unpasteurized Mexican-style soft cheese in the 7 days before onset of illness compared with 17 control subjects (28%) (matched odds ratio, 32.3; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-874.6). All case-patient isolates were phage definitive type 104 (DT104) (n = 10) or DT104b (n = 12), and 20 (91%) were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. The cheese produced and eaten by 2 unrelated patients was made with raw milk traced to the same local farm. Milk samples from nearby dairies yielded Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. The incidence of Salmonella Typhimurium infections in Yakima County returned to pre-1992 levels following interventions based on these findings.
   Conclusions Multidrug-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 emerged as a cause of salmonellosis in Yakima County, and Mexican-style soft cheese made with unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 transmission. We postulate that recent increases in human salmonellosis reflect the emergence of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 among dairy cows in the region. Continued efforts are needed to discourage consumption of raw milk products, promote healthier alternatives, and study the ecology of multidrug-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium.

AB A mozzarella cheese factory using an undefined, milk-derived Streptacoccus thermophilus starter system was monitored longitudinally for 2 years to determine whether the diversity of the resident bacteriophage population arose from environmental sources or from genetic changes in the resident phage in the factory. The two hypotheses led to different predictions about the genetic diversity of the phages. With respect to host range, 12 distinct phage types were observed. With two exceptions, phages belonging to different lytic groups showed clearly distinct restriction patterns slid multiple isolates of phages showing the same host range exhibited identical or highly related restriction patterns, Sequencing studies in a conserved region of the phage genome revealed no point mutations in multiple isolates of the same phage type, while up to 12% nucleotide sequence diversity was observed between the different phage types. This diversity is as large as that between the most different sequences from phages in our collection. These observations make unlikely a model that postulates a single phage invasion event and diversification of the phage during its residence in the factory, In the second stage of our factory study, a defined starter system was introduced that could not propagate the resident factory phage population, Within a week, three new phage types were observed in the factory while the resident phage population was decreased but not eliminated. Raw milk was the most likely source of these new phages, as phages with identical host ranges and restriction patterns were isolated from raw milk delivered to the factory during the intervention trial. Apparently, all of the genetic diversity observed in the S. thermophilus phages isolated during our survey was already created in their natural environment. A better understanding of the raw-milk ecology of S. thermophilus phages is thus essential for successful practical phage control.

AB Sixty one clinical and forty-nine environmental isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii from Australia and the United States were analyzed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), using 12- to 22-mer primers in pairs, and/or PCR fingerprinting with a single primer derived from the microsatellite core sequence of the wild-type phage M13 (5' GAGGGTGGCGGTTCT 3'), Three major genetic profiles were identified by both typing techniques, A single RAPD profile (VGI) predominated among clinical isolates (44 of 48, 92%) and isolates from host eucalypts (45 of 45, 100%) from Australia, Of the 94 Australian isolates, 4 (3 clinical and 1 environmental) were assigned to profile VGII; 2 of these were recovered from patients and one was recovered from plant debris from Western Australia, Only one Australian clinical isolate was assigned to profile VGIII, A different distribution of RAPD profiles (four VGIII, two VGII, and one VGI) was found among four clinical and three environmental isolates from the United States, RAPD profiles of 8 of the 101 isolates studied revealed minor genetic variants, 4 of profile VGI and 4 of profile VGII, Genetic concordance between the majority of clinical and environmental isolates in Australia is consistent with the hypothesis that human disease is acquired from exposure to host eucalypts, Profiles of clinical isolates were independent of body site of infection, and profiles of all isolates were stable over time. Analysis by PCR fingerprinting confirmed the RAPD results, A second RAPD profile (VGII) was associated with infection in southwest Western Australia, where the two host eucalypts do not occur naturally, This raises the possibility of an alternative and as yet unidentified natural habitat of C. neoformans var. gattii. Our results indicate that RAPD analysis is a sensitive and useful method for investigating environmental sources of human infection with this biotype.

AB Current estimates of viral abundance in natural waters rely on direct counts of virus-like particles (VLPs), using either transmission or epifluorescence microscopy. Direct counts of VLPs, while useful in studies of viral ecology, do not indicate whether the observed VLPs are capable of infection and/or replication. Rapid decay in bacteriophage viability under environmental conditions has been observed. However, it has not been firmly established whether there is a corresponding degradation of the virus particles, To address this question, viable and direct counts were carried out employing two Chesapeake Bay bacteriophages in experimental microcosms incubated for 56 h at two depths in the York River estuary, Viruses incubated in situ in microcosms at the surface yielded decay rates in full sunlight of 0.11 and 0.06 h(-1) for CB 38 Phi, and CB 7 Phi, respectively, The number of infective particles in microcosms in the dark and at a depth of 1 m was not significantly different from laboratory controls, with decay rates averaging 0.052 h(-1) for CB 38 Phi and 0.037 h(-1) for CB 7 Phi. Direct counts of bacteriophages decreased in the estuarine microcosms, albeit only at a rate of 0.028 h(-1), and were independent of treatment, Destruction of virus particles is concluded to be a process separate from loss of infectivity, It is also concluded that strong sunlight affects the viability of bacteriophages in surface waters, with the result that direct counts of VLPs overestimate the number of bacteriophage capable of both infection and replication, However, in deeper waters, where solar radiation is not a significant factor, direct counts should more accurately estimate numbers of viable bacteriophage.

AB Isolation and cultivation of marine bacteriophages have shown that they are ubiquitous in seawater, and direct counting has shown that the total numbers of viruses frequently exceed the bacterial concentration by a factor of 10. About 150 different isolates of phages from marine environments have been characterized in the literature reviewed in the present report. Knoblike projections on phage heads seem to be a morphological property more common in marine phages than among phages from other sources. The cultured phages were generally much larger than the majority of viruses observed by direct transmission electron microscopy of seawater samples, indicating that culturing methods are not providing unbiased samples of environmental viruses. Cultured marine viruses frequently are more sensitive to organic solvents than the more intensively studied phages from other sources. Burst sizes from recent in situ studies are 50% lower than the average from culture studies. Phages in the marine environment may have half lives lasting less than a day, with consequent high turnover. Host ranges varies, and cross species host ranges have not been demonstrated. More information and further development of methods are needed, both from culture and from in situ studies.

AB Eleven species are actually recognized within the genus Yersinia of which three - Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and certain serovars of Y. enterocolitica - are important infectious organisms for humans and warm-blooded animals.  The causative agents of yersiniosis, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica, occur world-wide in areas of moderate and subtropical climate.  Asymptomatically infected warm-blooded animals, causing environmental contamination, are the most important factors for the epidemiology of yersiniosis; apathogenic Yersinia species and serovars, on the other hand, are largely adapted to environmental conditions and, with regard to their ecology, independent from warm- or cold-blooded host organisms.  The agents are usually transmitted by the oral route with food-stuffs as the most important vehicle of human yersiniosis.
   For their isolation, enrichment procedures and selective media have been developed.  The organisms are identified by biochemical reactions and can be differentiated by serological and, in case of Y. enterocolitica, also by phage-typing methods.  The differentiation of pathogenic and apathogenic strains is of diagnostic importance and should be routinely performed; simple tests are available for this purpose.  Demonstration of antibodies against cell-wall-associated (lipoplysaccharide) or plasmid-encoded (protein) antigens may confirm the diagnosis if the causative agents failed to be isolated.
